1
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,316
WATER DEMON

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,985
Hello?

3
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:27,986
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

4
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,239
I'll see you there.
Are you sure you know the way?

5
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>Of course.</i>

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,791
That Water Demon.

7
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>It looks like you're living</i>
<i>quite a comfortable life.</i>

8
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,978
<i>Half-human, half-god.</i>

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,065
I see that you're growing trees
and flowers here.

10
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,483
You're raising earthworms too.

11
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,943
<i>It looks like you're pretending</i>
<i>to be a good person.</i>

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,070
What is it that you want?

13
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,404
I just want to get to know you.

14
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,823
And that thing on your body
which doesn't suit you at all.

15
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,575
Let's talk about that too.

16
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,993
Mr. Shin.

17
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,331
Your friends are here.

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,667
You didn't say
you were coming today, though.

19
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,044
That's right, Min.

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,588
Can I speak to that man again?

21
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,888
We just came to take a look,
and this girl was playing here alone.

22
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,681
She has nothing to do with this!

23
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,933
<i>That is true.</i>

24
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,935
Hurry up and get yourself here.

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,063
I really don't feel right about this.

26
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,692
Kiddo, you should go home now.

27
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,064
I sent the girl home.

28
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,774
Why don't we introduce ourselves?

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,236
You probably met Habaek
when he made a scene here yesterday.

30
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,322
My name is Biryeom, and this is Mura.

31
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,913
At least you seem to have the conscience
to not act like a god.

32
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,833
You're probably not as heartless
as I've heard.

33
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,294
You're so nice

34
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,920
to that blind little girl.

35
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,380
Or do you...

36
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,591
have no feelings for human beings?

37
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,551
I have no feelings
against you guys either.

38
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,927
Well, we do.

39
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,555
Our positions might differ, though.

40
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,141
When Mura was little,

41
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,019
she thought of you
as a disgrace to deities.

42
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,188
Now, she's more cautious.

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,399
She keeps giving you a chance.
She's probably getting old.

44
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,361
Habaek is just as you saw.
And as for me, it's pretty simple.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,906
I hate you.

46
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,284
And I will continue to hate you very much.

47
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,202
Because...

48
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,288
I'm different from you guys?

49
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,958
Let's just say that, halfie.

50
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,963
Just tell us why the sign is on your body.

51
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>Have you ever met the owner of that sign?</i>

52
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
A long time ago, by chance.

53
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,159
When and where?

54
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,411
When I arrived, where I arrived.

55
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,412
The land of deities?

56
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,833
He suddenly flew at me.

57
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:22,095
<i>A flash of lightning hit his back.</i>
<i>That's when I got the sign.</i>

58
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,598
-Did you know he was a god?
-Because of the sign.

59
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,517
Did you kill him?

60
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,159
<i>I heard all you can do</i>
<i>is destroy people and things.</i>

61
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,203
You don't like gods.

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,705
I heard you've killed a few.

63
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,164
That's not true.

64
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,041
Did you want to prove
that you're a god too,

65
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,419
albeit a halfie?

66
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,546
Biryeom, stop.

67
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,262
What's wrong?

68
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,224
-There's nothing on it.
-Why is the map here?

69
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,393
-The map?
-Why is it here?

70
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,913
What's with you?

71
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,207
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,922
He didn't move,

73
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,924
so I just went my way.

74
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,926
You went your way?

75
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,220
Judong was hit by the lightning
instead of you.

76
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,097
He saved you because
he thought you were human.

77
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,057
And...

78
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,059
you just left him there?

79
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,143
Did I...

80
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,103
make the lightning strike?

81
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,941
Back then, I wasn't who I am now.

82
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,820
<i>I was scared.</i>

83
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,366
<i>All I could do there was run away</i>
<i>as fast as I could.</i>

84
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,617
I did my best.

85
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,952
My lightning doesn't harm gods.

86
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,372
It doesn't hurt Judong either.

87
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,207
You must have done something.

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,136
Yes?

89
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,847
What?

90
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,314
Does that make sense?

91
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,526
It was hidden behind my map?

92
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,778
Why are they together?

93
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,239
Why?

94
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,992
Don't try to understand everything
that happens in the world.

95
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,871
That's ridiculous.

96
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,421
So...

97
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,299
you're going back now?

98
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,182
I guess you are.

99
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,685
That's right.

100
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,397
Congratulations.

101
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,608
Your hardships are over.
You can be happy now.

102
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,278
You can't invite me
to your coronation ceremony, can you?

103
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,364
See? Our friendship is pointless.

104
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:42,044
So,
the map doesn't tell you where to go?

105
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,339
It just helps you realize
where you want to go?

106
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,426
You're asking for the 46th time.

107
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,846
I don't think any human beings
could be here.

108
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:52,930
They're not human beings.

109
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,308
You're right.

110
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,852
Hasn't the hotel CEO done...

111
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,645
any suspicious things?

112
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,273
-Like what?
-Don't get too close to him.

113
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,442
It'll do you no good.

114
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,903
Why do you keep saying that?

115
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,780
He seems to be able to help me
more than you do.

116
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,700
You shouldn't judge him
just by his appearance.

117
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't worry.

118
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,412
I'm a psychiatrist.

119
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,457
I can see through people.

120
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,045
Mr. Shin seems like
an almost perfect human being.

121
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,172
An almost perfect human being?

122
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,383
You can see as much as you know.

123
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,386
Don't be prejudiced against him
if you don't know him well.

124
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,596
What about you?

125
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,224
How much do you know about him?

126
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,391
Sorry?

127
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,977
You look like such an easy person to fool.

128
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,940
Wait. Gosh!

129
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,279
Sorry.

130
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,242
Take my hand.

131
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,629
It's okay. I can walk on my own.

132
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,593
I can go anywhere on my own.

133
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,152
What are you doing?

134
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,449
What are you doing here?

135
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,306
Who...

136
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,101
Who are you?

137
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,354
What...

138
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,065
What do you mean?

139
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,080
Do I...

140
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,798
know you?

141
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,053
Why am I so drawn to earth?

142
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,474
I'm so drawn to earth, like a mole.

143
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,649
<i>How can a god lose his memory?</i>

144
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,903
Hey, did you change your religion?

145
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,364
He lost his power...

146
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,367
and he lost his memory.

147
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,245
You're full of flaws.

148
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,247
You couldn't get in touch with us

149
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,166
because of your memory loss?

150
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,837
Where is my sacred stone?

151
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,758
Save us from this turmoil...

152
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,848
He'll sleep for a while.

153
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,394
It'll take some time for him to wake up.

154
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,105
How could he...

155
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,023
lose his memory?

156
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,694
-Why are you still here?
-Sorry?

157
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,362
Send her.

158
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,115
A servant shouldn't get involved
with gods' matters.

159
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,742
-I'll have to go with--
-Sure.

160
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,453
I guess you're not coming home tonight.

161
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,247
I hope everything will work out.

162
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,042
Do you need a ride?

163
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,339
Hye-ra.

164
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,801
I've given up on Habaek,

165
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,095
but can't you speak to me more politely?

166
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,222
I understand the situation for you two,

167
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,142
but I get offended every time.

168
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,060
What have you been doing?

169
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,479
Why is she still saying that to me?

170
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,317
Listen up, you lowly human.

171
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,696
I'm the most beautiful goddess
and the most sublime creature.

172
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,198
-I'm the mightiest water goddess--
-Sure, sure.

173
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,727
Gosh, seriously.

174
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,774
He's so mean.

175
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,531
What Mr. Shin said was right.

176
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,035
This idiot here kept accusing him
of killing Judong.

177
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,704
Why do you keep taking that jerk's side?

178
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,207
I'm not taking anyone's side.
I'm saying you shouldn't meddle.

179
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,541
What did I tell you in the past?

180
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,294
I told you to run far away, Biryeom.

181
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,338
And I told you to ignore him, Habaek.

182
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,131
Why should we be afraid of him?

183
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:24,178
You're old enough now.
Can't you please grow up?

184
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,764
That's precisely why I'm not running away.

185
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,393
You two immature gods drive me crazy.

186
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,104
Mura is right. All is well
now that we've found Judong.

187
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,649
-Don't provoke him anymore.
-You heard that, right?

188
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,776
Giving him attention
means you acknowledge his powers.

189
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,198
You should go back as soon as
you get the sacred stones from Judong.

190
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,909
Keeping this one under control
is stressful enough.

191
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,335
You don't like high places.

192
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,594
Isn't it fascinating?

193
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,763
We only have nights and days.

194
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,474
Humans have nights, days,

195
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,768
and things like that.

196
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,063
Think about how tough
humans' lives must be.

197
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,690
Biryeom must like it here.

198
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,943
-What about you?
-Other than pretty clothes,

199
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,069
there's nothing I like.

200
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,029
I want to go back as soon as possible.

201
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,202
We've found Judong.

202
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,288
Why don't you look happy?

203
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,335
I am happy.

204
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,257
-Last night--
-I remember.

205
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,217
I said Biryeom was wrong.

206
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,430
I want to go back as soon as possible.

207
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,894
That girl, our servant, is--

208
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,896
Before I came here,
the High Priest told me

209
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,816
to find out why the sacred stones
are kept in the human world.

210
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:06,322
Now that I'm about to leave,
I became curious about the reason.

211
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,781
Why would you be curious about it?

212
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,160
You lose when your curiosity is piqued.
Shouldn't you know him better by now?

213
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,662
He always makes vague, cryptic remarks
that make you think.

214
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,624
Do you know why he does it?
It's because he doesn't know either.

215
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,834
And if he's caught, he can't be
the High Priest anymore.

216
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,462
Is that so?

217
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,883
I'll tell you the reason.

218
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,969
The sacred stones are kept here

219
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,014
because the future king needs to learn
about humans before his enthronement.

220
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,809
The reasons why the human world
can't belong to the divine realm

221
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,020
and why things must stay this way.

222
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,319
But as for you,

223
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,364
you already learned it 1,200 years ago.

224
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,991
You already know what humans are like.

225
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,745
We didn't even want human sacrifice,

226
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,706
yet they drowned a woman in the sea
so that they could live.

227
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,251
We looked after them out of pity,

228
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,421
and they forgot their place,
then started lusting after eternal life.

229
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,757
They repaid our love with betrayal

230
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,467
and turned the divine world upside down.

231
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,679
Humans are cruel, greedy, and foolish.

232
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,474
What more is there to learn about them?

233
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,437
Go back.

234
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,109
So-a isn't one of the things
you'll need to look after as a king.

235
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,112
Even if she's lucky and gets included,

236
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,532
she's as insignificant as a speck of dust.

237
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,412
I don't know why you're hesitating,

238
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,416
but I won't just spectate this time.

239
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,343
When you were an intern,

240
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,387
I told you that psychiatry
isn't right for you.

241
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,848
I warned you that you'd find it hard
as you're too empathetic.

242
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,766
I told you orthopedics
would be perfect for you.

243
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,021
I only have two friends,
and both of them nag me like crazy.

244
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,731
Do I have that many flaws?

245
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,317
People with too much self-esteem
like me have problems too,

246
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,029
but people with no self-esteem
like you are surely a problem.

247
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,196
Yeom-mi.

248
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,450
I'd just think, "Everyone is worried
about losing me."

249
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,702
That's obviously not why Sang-yu nags me.

250
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,288
He worries about you more
than you worry about yourself.

251
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,914
A person like him is rare these days.

252
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,792
He's an orphan, but your dad looked
after him and educated him.

253
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,170
He wants to return the kindness
by taking care of you.

254
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,964
When I see him, I think that
there's still hope in this world.

255
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,675
Do you know how angry I get
when I see him?

256
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,678
My dad practically abandoned me
and my mom to take care of those kids.

257
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,847
-The orphans?
-That's right. Among them,

258
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,058
Sang-yu is the most successful one.

259
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,894
Don't you think it's crazy?

260
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,898
Whenever I see that idiot,
my blood starts boiling.

261
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,275
It basically confirms that my dad
is an incompetent loser.

262
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,111
He keeps reminding me of that
over and over.

263
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,323
Then do you actually want Sang-yu
to leave you?

264
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,500
Hey, let's go to karaoke.
I don't want to go back to an empty house.

265
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,086
I want to go home early.

266
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,338
I have to watch the rerun
of <i>Temple Cook Master Baek.</i>

267
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,430
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

268
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,516
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

269
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,060
<i>Happy birthday, dear Eun-mi</i>

270
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,978
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

271
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,732
-Hey, happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

272
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,735
-Where did you get this?
-We bought it together.

273
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,278
-Let's take a picture.
-Thanks!

274
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,197
Inside, there is...

275
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,782
-Gosh, what is it?
-What are you doing?

276
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,492
Come on.

277
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,398
<i>-Yes, Dr. Yun.</i>
-Where are you now?

278
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,607
I'm at the clinic.

279
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,984
<i>Why are you still there?</i>

280
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,443
<i>Let's go to karaoke together.</i>

281
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,903
Karaoke.

282
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,905
I'm waiting for Hyeong-sik now.

283
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,842
They're never there for me
when I need them.

284
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,805
Yeom-mi was chewing ice cubes
in front of me to annoy me.

285
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,667
I used to walk here alone all the time.

286
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,661
HABAEK
YUN SO-A

287
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,935
WATER DEMON

288
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,615
-Hello?
-<i>Why are you getting home now?</i>

289
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,802
You said you wouldn't be
able to come home.

290
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,265
Have his memories come back?

291
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,185
Not yet. They said it'll take a few days.

292
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,646
Then...

293
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,898
why are you here?

294
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,696
To turn on the lights.

295
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,267
Why are you crying?

296
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,358
I'm smiling.

297
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,486
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:40,919
Good night.

299
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,695
How do you do that? You can kill things
just by touching them, right?

300
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,535
<i>What is he doing?</i>

301
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,975
What was that?

302
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,770
Who is he? What did he just do?

303
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,943
I must be imagining things.

304
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,113
But I clearly saw...

305
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,491
The flowers...

306
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,452
The flowers...

307
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,464
What brings you here this early?

308
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,761
I saw everything.

309
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,054
What do you mean?

310
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,390
You did something weird to the flowers.

311
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,101
I almost passed out.

312
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,064
-What are you talking about?
-Fine.

313
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,441
Keep denying it.

314
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,319
I've been thinking so hard.

315
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,280
What was that?

316
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,614
What was that?

317
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,786
It couldn't be explained
scientifically or logically.

318
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,289
I graduated from medical school.

319
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,748
I studied science.

320
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,918
In the end,

321
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,087
I found the answer.

322
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,425
I always thought you were extraordinary.

323
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,261
You're so sly.

324
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,638
-You--
-Ja-ya.

325
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,434
You can even do magic tricks?

326
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,185
When did you learn them?

327
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,314
You're so talented.

328
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,526
I don't understand

329
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,862
why you'd keep that from others.

330
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,573
But I respect your decision.

331
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,997
You're such an amazing magician.

332
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,710
But stop performing
such creepy tricks from now on.

333
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,920
Why would you kill
those beautiful flowers?

334
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,842
Revive withered flowers instead.

335
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,722
What?

336
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,021
What?

337
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,095
I'm sorry. You should go.

338
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,222
Well...

339
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,391
Okay.

340
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,069
Good job.

341
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,922
Are you not feeling well?

342
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,342
Are you tired?

343
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,521
<i>She left in such a hurry,</i>
<i>so I became curious.</i>

344
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,898
She probably saw something
she shouldn't have seen.

345
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,025
I was worried.

346
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,611
What were you thinking?

347
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,743
All right. Let's just go back to
what we were talking about.

348
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,495
-When did you come here?
-About ten years ago.

349
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,289
Did you escape that cave?

350
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,791
I was abandoned.

351
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,085
After taking you away from your mother,

352
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,420
why did he abandon you?

353
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,424
I didn't know you were here.

354
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,802
You hadn't come to the cave for long.

355
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,263
I just assumed you didn't want to come...

356
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,973
anymore.

357
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,850
I came here 500 years ago.

358
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,644
I got in trouble with deities
in the Land of Water, so I had to run.

359
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,980
When Lord Habaek
brought a stone covered in blood,

360
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,231
I realized right away.

361
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,317
I was worried.

362
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,028
But you seem to be doing well.

363
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,030
I met some nice people.

364
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,365
I see. You were lucky.

365
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,075
You could even hold back your desire.

366
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,328
You seem to have control over your power.

367
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,246
I once told you

368
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,374
thorns should be removed
for leaves and stalks to grow.

369
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,710
When I thought about you,

370
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,087
I regretted saying that to you.

371
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,591
You had been imprisoned in a cave
for 3,000 years.

372
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,718
I'm sure it gave you no hope.

373
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:10,016
I just wanted to make sure
it was really you.

374
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,977
You won't see me again.

375
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,565
There's something I want to know.

376
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,653
Habaek...

377
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,447
was with a human girl.

378
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,658
And she seemed to know who they were.

379
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,545
Newspaper.

380
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,341
Do you want to have breakfast with me?

381
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,273
Gosh!

382
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,987
-Is this edible?
-Yes.

383
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,406
It doesn't look like
it requires two hours of cooking.

384
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,740
Eat up.

385
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,751
How is it?

386
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,503
Bad.

387
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,589
Gosh!

388
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,133
Can you say something nice
even if you don't mean it?

389
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,342
You're making me embarrassed.

390
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,012
-I only tell the truth.
-You only tell the truth?

391
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,724
I'm a psychiatrist.

392
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,060
I got such good grades too.
I got an A+ in psychology.

393
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,147
I bet I can figure out all of your lies
if I put my mind to it.

394
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,189
Lies?

395
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,482
What lies?

396
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,568
The reason
why the gods punished my family.

397
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,738
The real reason isn't
what you told me, right?

398
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,326
You're not telling me because
you don't want to face the truth.

399
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,246
You must've been talking about
the woman with the surname, Shim,

400
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,332
to consciously escape from the topic.

401
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,001
I bet you want to think it never happened.

402
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,964
The gods must've feared
my ancestors very much.

403
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,884
How scary!
Was it like the story of Lord Voldemort?

404
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,639
Is it your trauma?

405
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,475
I'm pretty good at treating PTSD.

406
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,393
Shall we come home together today?

407
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,562
It's my day off.

408
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,149
-Let's do something else together.
-Something else?

409
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,922
Gosh, it's hot!

410
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,109
I'm exhausted.

411
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,114
We got rid of
all the million-year-old dust.

412
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,867
-"A million years"?
-It used to get deep-cleaned often.

413
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,535
There were many people to help clean too.

414
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,246
-I never lifted a finger, though.
-Why not?

415
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,499
Back then, I couldn't stand
the house looking squeaky clean.

416
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,961
You should lie down
and straighten your back.

417
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,840
-I'm okay.
-Why? Stretching like this feels nice.

418
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,675
-Lie down.
-I said I don't want to.

419
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,557
-Why don't you want to?
-I'm still a man.

420
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,142
So what?

421
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,482
What?

422
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,235
Goodness, I didn't tell you
to lie down right here.

423
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,528
You told me to lie down.

424
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,285
You said I should lie down.

425
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,539
My gosh!

426
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,756
You told me to lie down.

427
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,217
Well...

428
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,676
this isn't what I meant.

429
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,807
How dare you try to seduce me?

430
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,893
When did I seduce you?

431
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,857
There's something I learned
from the newspapers and the news.

432
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,527
They're all such animals.

433
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,697
-Who?
-All men.

434
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,994
It's not right to assume
that all men are criminals.

435
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,413
I said they're animals, not criminals.

436
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,877
So do not tell men
to lie down with you like this.

437
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,589
Don't hug any guy from behind
and cry like you did yesterday.

438
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,217
You really should be more cautious.

439
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,513
Why are you acting like
a protective brother all of a sudden?

440
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,228
I should go take a warm bath.

441
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,939
SAUNA FOR MEN AND WOMEN

442
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,111
How was the water?

443
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:56,946
It was good.

444
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,032
-Don't you like the aroma in there?
-Not really.

445
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,784
Because it doesn't smell like roses?

446
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,505
Another day is gone.

447
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,048
We didn't even do much today.

448
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,383
What are you talking about?

449
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,094
We ate, cleaned the house,
and even took a warm bath.

450
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,388
You're right.

451
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,432
What do you usually do on your day off?

452
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,395
I can't really remember what I used to do.

453
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,607
Isn't that because you used to do nothing?

454
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,359
What? Is that why?

455
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,409
That's not how you're supposed to ride it.
Hold this for me.

456
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,411
Hey, kids.

457
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,414
Kids, that's not how it's done.
I'll show you.

458
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,750
It'll be much more fun this way.
Watch me carefully.

459
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,085
Keep your eyes on me.
Don't take your eyes off of me.

460
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,338
Ta-da! Twist it like this first.

461
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,382
Then let it go. What do you think?

462
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,842
Gosh!

463
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,807
It must have scared you guys. Don't cry.

464
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,768
She's old enough. What is wrong with her?

465
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,187
Let's go. Let's go home now.

466
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,147
Don't. Just stay there.

467
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,900
I can get up myself.

468
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,363
What?

469
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,450
I didn't know she'd be capable of
embarrassing me like this.

470
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,413
Gosh. Where did that guy go?

471
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,040
Hey, wait!

472
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,584
Hey, wait up!

473
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,295
Gosh, seriously. Hey, Water Demon!

474
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,632
Right. She must be a divine servant.

475
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,092
A divine servant?

476
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,427
To be more accurate,
a servant of high-up gods.

477
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,305
They don't really need
such servants, though.

478
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,893
-How did she become a divine servant?
-1,200 years ago, you...

479
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,230
Well...

480
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:58,109
I heard that her ancestors
committed a grave sin.

481
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,318
Her ancestors?

482
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,362
What does that have to do with her?

483
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,365
You're actually the one
who really needs a divine servant.

484
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,575
Since she's a divine servant,

485
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,162
she'd be able to understand
and accept you as who you are.

486
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,542
Having her around
will make you feel less lonely.

487
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,628
You have to continuously be born,
grow up, and die.

488
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,048
That vicious cycle
is too much for you to handle on your own.

489
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,396
Don't you think you were so mean?

490
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,107
How could you leave me alone
in the sand like that?

491
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,817
I thought you wanted me
to leave you alone.

492
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,194
You took off before I even said that.

493
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,322
It's what you wanted, so it's all good.

494
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,073
How can that be...

495
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:50,161
That's not the conclusion.
You have this way of twisting words.

496
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,454
Does it hurt a lot?

497
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,872
Of course it hurts.

498
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,415
Let me see.

499
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,798
-Well, it's--
-Just stay still.

500
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,315
My powers aren't coming back.

501
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,816
You're unbelievable.

502
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,860
Did you just use me again?

503
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,280
Why is this still here?

504
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,865
Just leave it.

505
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,033
Why?

506
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,161
-You're leaving soon. It'll be confusing.
-I'm not leaving right now.

507
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,330
You'll leave anyway.

508
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,623
I told you to just leave it.

509
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,542
Procrastination is bad.

510
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,382
Gosh, look at this man. I mean,
you are not a man. Look at this god.

511
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,800
Hey.

512
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,636
There's another one here.

513
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,263
Look, fried chicken!

514
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,316
I don't have the water you like.

515
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,152
Really? Then I'll just go.

516
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,695
Hey, hang on.

517
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,155
The door is this way.

518
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,033
I think you use a different door.

519
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,786
It's connected to my room, isn't it?

520
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,956
This is your door. Please use this door.

521
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,876
How heartless.

522
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,302
That was such a sly move.

523
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,515
Why does he wear things like that
these days? It doesn't suit him.

524
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,350
Is that the style that's in among gods?

525
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,936
If people see him, they'll think that...

526
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,980
Gosh, should I buy him new clothes?

527
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,983
<i>A shaved ice dessert truck is outside.</i>

528
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,526
Go eat some and get some rest.

529
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,361
Okay. Thank you so much.

530
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,201
Why are you here
instead of watching Judong?

531
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,204
Judong isn't important now.
You're in the enemy's territory.

532
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,416
Don't cause trouble and just go.

533
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,584
Do you know what?

534
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,627
The more you try to protect him,

535
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,672
the more mischievous I become.

536
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,634
You're strange.
You're being overly hostile toward him.

537
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,018
Goodbye,

538
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,811
my sweet drunk.

539
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,898
You were...

540
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,652
my everything. I'll remember you forever.

541
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,039
I'm going to kill you if you faint again.

542
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,208
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

543
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,296
He fainted again.

544
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,131
Hey.

545
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,258
-Wake up.
-Hey.

546
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,093
My gosh!

547
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,264
Hye-ra...

548
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,601
Tell them to either fire me or him.

549
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,062
Never mind. I'll just quit.

550
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,939
Just pay them the cancellation fee.

551
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,483
Hye...

552
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,528
Aren't you going to do as I say?

553
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,948
Hye...

554
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,242
Don't worry. You can leave.
I'll take care of it.

555
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,911
-That's...
-Thank you so much.

556
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,499
What are you going to take care of?

557
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,752
There is a way, you know.

558
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,963
You can just shoot movies like <i>Amazons.</i>

559
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,258
You can be Artemis, the goddess of
the unconquered wilderness.

560
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,968
There's also Athena, the goddess of war.

561
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,430
Of course, Aphrodite is the actual
goddess of beauty.

562
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,724
But the other two also have
a very strong fan base.

563
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,310
Athena is known for
bringing victory in war by using

564
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,521
fear, struggle, defense, and attack.

565
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,857
So I think the role of Athena suits you
better than the role of Artemis.

566
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,402
Do you want me to
crush that tongue of yours?

567
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,374
We found our friend thanks to you.

568
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,584
I'm glad.

569
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,005
But he's completely ruined.

570
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,299
What did you do to him?

571
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,306
We're in the process of fixing him.

572
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,017
You ruin things and we fix them.

573
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,020
That's the crucial difference
between you and us.

574
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,779
See you again.

575
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,347
You're really strange.

576
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,432
You act like you have
personal feelings towards him.

577
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,850
Why do you keep acting that way?

578
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,518
Even Habaek's not doing anything to him.

579
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:09,772
Habaek?

580
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,358
He's used to not doing anything.

581
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,736
And I'm used to causing trouble.

582
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,821
What's wrong with you?

583
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,783
I've always been like this.
Why are you being so sensitive?

584
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,493
It's because you seem pitiful.

585
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,536
You said...

586
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,456
I shouldn't seem pathetic
when I'm a goddess.

587
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,415
I agree with you.

588
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,335
You shouldn't seem pitiful
when you're a god.

589
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,800
About that kissing scene...

590
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,552
why don't you practice before shooting?

591
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,471
What?

592
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,520
It's the guy whose tongue you destroyed.

593
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,522
Hey, Jingeon.

594
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,816
Stop the car.

595
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,448
You can go first.
Take good care of Judong.

596
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,576
Where are you going?

597
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,255
<i>We're in the process of fixing him.</i>

598
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,674
You ruin things and we fix them.

599
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,261
That's the crucial difference
between you and us.

600
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,473
Yes?

601
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,227
The development team
are having a meeting today

602
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,479
regarding the final contract
for the landowners.

603
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,107
But the contract with Ms. Yun
needs to be cleared first.

604
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,942
-I understand.
-Okay, sir.

605
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,833
AGREEMENT PROPOSAL
ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLOCK WORLD

606
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,302
<i>No way.</i>

607
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:05,929
Are you serious?

608
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,051
What are you planning to do?

609
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,312
How dare you covet our land
when you're nothing but a halfie?

610
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,024
You knew from the beginning, didn't you?
Is that why you approached So-a?

611
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,234
No.

612
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,027
-You're lying.
-I don't lie.

613
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,530
I'm not immature.

614
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,326
I only speak the truth.

615
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,412
Listen to me carefully.

616
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,581
You asked me what I'm planning to do.

617
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,834
You said the crucial difference
between you and me is that

618
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,794
I ruin things while you fix them.

619
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,921
That's what I'm planning to do...

620
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,465
on this great land of yours.

621
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,679
You can use your imagination
to guess what I'm planning to do.

622
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,652
Let me tell you one more thing...

623
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,155
while we're on the subject.

624
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,200
It's about that friend of yours
who got ruined.

625
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,535
You're right.

626
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,704
I did that to him.

627
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,708
But...

628
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,837
what difference would it make,
even if I confess my wrongdoing?

629
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,341
You gods think of yourselves as saviors!

630
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,762
So, what can you do to me?
Do you plan to kill me or what?

631
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,805
Can you...

632
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,186
do a better job in doing that than I can?

633
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,117
<i>She sold that land to him?</i>

634
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,370
Didn't you know about it at all?

635
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,832
<i>Are you trying to sell the land</i>
<i>because of money?</i>

636
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,833
<i>Because you need money?</i>

637
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,629
That's right. I wouldn't sell it
if the situation wasn't so bad.

638
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,922
Then do whatever you want.

639
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,967
Didn't you say having a lot of money
will make you happy?

640
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:36,932
I told her to sell it.

641
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,434
-What?
-It doesn't matter to us.

642
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,645
The Divine Gate won't disappear
because the owner has changed.

643
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,271
You think the gate won't disappear?

644
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,400
How can you be sure
he won't do anything to that land?

645
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,278
He's capable of filling that land
with people all the time.

646
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,907
If that land becomes crowded with people
day and night,

647
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,993
we will have to abandon the gate.

648
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,079
If we stop visiting this place,
the human world will disappear.

649
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,670
I never thought you were pathetic...

650
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,257
even when I heard that
you had lost your powers.

651
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,968
I do tend to run wild at times,
and I'm more foolish than you are.

652
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,971
But I never once forgot my identity

653
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,764
just because I fell for a human girl.

654
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,851
But then again,
this isn't your first time.

655
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,729
Do you know what really gets on my nerves?

656
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,940
You never once did anything,
but you act as if you're the victim.

657
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,484
Then you make me feel guilty.

658
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,778
It's as annoying as...

659
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,490
you becoming the king
without even doing anything.

660
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,668
Okay.

661
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,757
Go and see what your servant...

662
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,550
No.

663
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,887
Go and see what your woman is up to now.

664
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,571
Hello.

665
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,032
Please sit down.

666
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,460
I need to know the real reason
for me to fully understand

667
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,921
and convince my employees.

668
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:33,965
I asked you once

669
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,551
if there was anyone
who's against selling that land.

670
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,719
Are you doing this...

671
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,429
because of that person?

672
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,018
Yes, kind of.

673
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,647
But he didn't order me to do it.

674
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,274
I just feel like I should do this
to make me feel at ease.

675
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,819
Not many people refuse
a hundred million won...

676
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,403
just to be at ease.

677
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,322
I learned that the one...

678
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,078
who has more should naturally help
the one who has less.

679
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,876
My father taught me this.

680
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,336
Is that person...

681
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,090
the man I saw at my hotel last time?

682
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:21,263
He didn't seem like someone
who has less than you.

683
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,265
It's also natural...

684
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,184
for the strong to protect the weak.

685
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,854
That's how the world should be.

686
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,149
Just because
someone has more than you...

687
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,901
doesn't mean that person
is stronger than you.

688
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,902
So...

689
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,864
are you saying
that you're stronger than him?

690
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,575
The damage to me of giving up
on a hundred million won

691
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,452
is smaller than the damage to him
losing that land.

692
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,122
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

693
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,540
Is it because he's the wind?

694
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,333
Sorry?

695
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,712
Didn't you tell me
that the wind had stopped blowing?

696
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:04,139
I don't think that's something
we need to talk about right now.

697
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,267
I don't think
I deserve to be interrogated.

698
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,686
I'm not interrogating you.
I'm just checking.

699
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,065
Anyway,

700
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,152
that has nothing to do with this decision.

701
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:25,619
I forgot that you tend to care too much
about other people.

702
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,831
I also forgot that it was why
I was interested in you.

703
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:31,958
Mr. Shin--

704
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,462
I now know your opinion,
so I'll try convincing my employees.

705
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,506
The one who has more should help
the one who has less,

706
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,760
and the strong should help the weak.

707
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,012
That also coincides with the way I live.

708
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,932
However, I cannot agree
with your statement

709
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,227
that the man you wish to help
is weaker than you.

710
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,229
I'll contact you.

711
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,736
I can see through everyone's feelings...

712
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,488
except for you.

713
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,784
It doesn't seem to work on you,
but what you're feeling right now...

714
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,452
is quite obvious.

715
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,206
You're filled with anger, contempt,
and confusion.

716
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,749
That's what you're feeling.

717
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,961
Nothing will change even
if the Divine Gate ends up in your hands.

718
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,337
That's not what's important.

719
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,630
I have no interest...

720
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,632
in that gate.

721
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,510
What I'm interested in right now...

722
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,053
is Yun So-a.

723
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,227
She'll become the first
and strongest desire I've ever had

724
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,771
since my life in this world began.

725
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,399
Of course I'll win her heart
by fair means.

726
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,236
I'd like to thank you for making me
realize my feelings toward her.

727
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,322
What kind of nonsense
are you saying right now?

728
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,408
-She is a divine servant.
-What does that matter?

729
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,036
This is the world of humans,
and it's my turf.

730
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,747
You said you're going to return
to your world.

731
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,792
Ms. Yun referred to you
as a wind that's passing by. No.

732
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,337
She said the wind has stopped blowing.

733
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:46,134
Your friend seems to think that I'm going
to harm the world of deities.

734
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,510
But please tell him this.

735
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,847
I seriously have no interest
in both you and your world.

736
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,893
So, you should head back
without having to worry about anything.

737
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,936
MY SERVANT

738
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,530
WATER DEMON

739
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,158
-<i>Yes?</i>
-What took you so long?

740
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,578
Hello?

741
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,496
Keep talking.

742
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,083
Why are you being so cold?

743
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,835
Keep going.

744
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,002
<i>Are you at home?</i>

745
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,088
Yes.

746
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,175
What?

747
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,178
You said you never tell lies.

748
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,889
Did you go outside for a walk?

749
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,600
Yes. Why?

750
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:21,855
I just did something for you a while ago.

751
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,899
I can't tell you anything specific
right now,

752
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,901
but I just wanted to let you know.

753
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,696
-Where are you?
-I'm going to head home now.

754
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:33,116
<i>Wait. Let's take a walk together</i>
<i>since you're outside.</i>

755
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,117
No, never mind.

756
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,161
It's time for dinner.

757
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,370
Let's have dinner together.

758
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:38,955
<i>Where are you?</i>

759
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,957
<i>I'll come to where you are.</i>

760
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,126
<i>Hello?</i>

761
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,410
<i>You said you're going to return</i>
<i>to your world.</i>

762
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:21,206
Ms. Yun referred to you
as the wind that's passing by. No.

763
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,083
She said that the wind
has stopped blowing.

764
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,510
You're here.

765
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,057
Why are you still so serious?

766
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,686
I said let's have dinner.
Why did you want to--

767
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,604
Did you...

768
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,523
sell that land?

769
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,442
-What?
-Did you sell it to that hotel owner?

770
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,446
Yes.

771
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,616
-But--
-I know.

772
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,077
I told you to do as you please.

773
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,996
But you can't sell it to him.
I won't allow it.

774
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,083
Is that why you were so angry all along?

775
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,507
It's true that I sold it to him,
but I asked him to give it back.

776
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,760
I felt uncomfortable about it too.

777
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,347
I felt sorry even when I didn't have to.

778
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,683
I walked on eggshells
even when I didn't have to.

779
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,769
I don't know why I felt that way
when it's my land.

780
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,522
I don't know why when you had already
told me to do as I please.

781
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,441
I don't know why I felt that way
when you're going to leave anyway.

782
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,569
But I asked him if I could
break the contract for you.

783
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,196
I don't know why, but I just did.

784
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,116
The fact that you sold it and
asked for it back isn't what's important.

785
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,742
It's not important?

786
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,581
Then what did I do all this time...

787
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,876
with something that's not even important?

788
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,964
What did I do until now?

789
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,091
What you did with him

790
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,844
and what you plan to do with him
has nothing to do with me.

791
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,389
What?

792
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,560
Yes.

793
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,772
You're right.

794
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,692
I'm going to leave soon.

795
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,154
And you belong to this world.

796
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,742
So we should not waste time
being each other's happiness.

797
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,494
We should not mistake fake wings...

798
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,000
for wings that can fly.

799
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,467
"The ones who smile...

800
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,179
during hardships are the winners.

801
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,642
The ones who endure it...

802
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,393
are lesser.

803
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,440
The ones who cry...

804
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,860
are losers."

805
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,076
I guess I'm a loser.

806
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,127
I've become a loser...

807
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,675
because of you.

808
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,471
You're a really bad god.

809
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:28,935
I tried so hard to have a strong heart.

810
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,690
I at least had to become a minor
if I couldn't become a winner.

811
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,234
Because I'm alone...

812
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,406
I had to be strong so that...

813
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,866
I could prevent myself...

814
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,745
from crying like a weak-minded person.

815
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,835
I thought I became a winner...

816
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,547
after meeting you.

817
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,343
But I can see now that...

818
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,180
I've only become a loser.

819
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,228
I'm going to leave.

820
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,524
I have to leave.

821
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,403
I said I'm going to leave.

822
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,192
<i>-Judong woke up.</i>
<i>-Where's the sacred stone?</i>

823
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,236
<i>I can really see the end now.</i>

824
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,321
<i>Is it because of that girl?</i>

825
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,448
<i>You're worried</i>
<i>Habaek might already like her.</i>

826
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,408
<i>You've lost him once.</i>
<i>I know you don't want to lose him again.</i>

827
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,451
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

828
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:16,203
<i>If you don't want to do</i>
<i>the dirty work yourself, just tell me.</i>

829
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,456
<i>Why are you doing this to me? Why?</i>

830
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,541
<i>Without hurting anyone.</i>

831
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,293
<i>The ending should be beautiful.</i>

832
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,961
<i>Is what you're feeling now</i>

833
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,464
<i>sympathy toward humans or love?</i>

834
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,675
<i>If I could, I'd really love</i>
<i>to live with her.</i>

835
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,093
<i>Here in this world.</i>
