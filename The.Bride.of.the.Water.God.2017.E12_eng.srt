1
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,335
<i>Habaek.</i>

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>Habaek.</i>

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,383
<i>Habaek.</i>

4
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>Nak-bin was going to be used</i>
<i>as a sacrificial offering.</i>

5
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,351
<i>Human sacrifice.</i>

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,228
<i>It's what foolish humans used to do.</i>

7
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,692
<i>But Habaek fell in love</i>
<i>with the human offering given to us,</i>

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>so shall we say that he was</i>
<i>even more foolish than humans?</i>

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>The King of the Land of the Sky</i>
<i>had a vain dream of</i>

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,956
<i>breaking the rules of the divine realm</i>
<i>and building a new order.</i>

11
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,710
<i>He thought he could achieve it</i>
<i>by stealing Habaek's powers.</i>

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,212
Habaek.

13
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,550
<i>He promised Habaek's woman eternal life,</i>

14
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,387
<i>and that foolish woman gladly promised him</i>
<i>that she'd betray Habaek.</i>

15
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:41,226
<i>Thus, she fooled Habaek</i>
<i>and put him under the curse.</i>

16
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,270
<i>Do you think she ended up gaining</i>
<i>eternal life that she so longed for?</i>

17
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,779
The sun will go down soon.

18
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,057
Nak-bin.

19
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,896
<i>Habaek.</i>

20
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,318
<i>Habaek.</i>

21
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,571
The Queen Mother...

22
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,115
wants to kill you.

23
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,494
She wants to use your blood...

24
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,499
to break the curse you brought upon us.

25
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,758
The eternal life you've been
desperately longing for

26
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,635
will be granted to you along with death.

27
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,430
Neither nirvana nor reincarnation...

28
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,685
will be allowed.

29
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,687
<i>Help me.</i>

30
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,397
<i>Please.</i>

31
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,899
<i>Save me, Habaek. Please.</i>

32
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,448
I will...

33
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,744
never forgive you.

34
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,457
I came to tell you this.

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,003
<i>Habaek, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</i>

36
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,089
<i>Please, Habaek! I didn't know.</i>

37
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,841
<i>I had no idea that it was a curse.</i>

38
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,178
<i>I did it out of love.</i>

39
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,307
<i>I wanted to live eternally with you.</i>

40
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,101
<i>I love you, Habaek. I love you...</i>

41
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,479
<i>Please. I love you.</i>

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,024
<i>Habaek!</i>

43
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:26,969
<i>Habaek.</i>

44
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,616
Please don't kill me!

45
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,285
Please!

46
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,854
No! Please!

47
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,487
No.

48
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,532
Habaek! Habaek! Help me!

49
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,706
Habaek, please help me.

50
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,794
Habaek, please don't kill me!

51
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,480
Help...

52
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,559
<i>However,</i>
<i>taking that woman's insignificant life</i>

53
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,978
<i>was not enough to appease</i>
<i>the Queen Mother's fury.</i>

54
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,609
<i>The Queen Mother wanted her brother</i>
<i>and his son to pay for her sins as well.</i>

55
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,570
Please spare our lives.

56
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,322
<i>The brother begged for mercy.</i>

57
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,949
<i>Then the Queen Mother asked him</i>
<i>what he could give her in return,</i>

58
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,826
<i>and the foolish man promised her</i>

59
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>that his family would serve the gods</i>
<i>generation after generation.</i>

60
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,172
That's absurd.

61
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,883
And what does that have to do with me?

62
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,219
Even if one of my ancestors
betrayed his country,

63
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,096
killed someone, or stole something
a thousand years ago,

64
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,847
what does that have to do with me now?

65
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,518
Am I supposed to feel guilty
for what that woman did?

66
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,563
Too bad. You can only feel guilty

67
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,608
when you actually did something wrong.

68
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,279
As for this story,
I can't even relate to it.

69
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,781
You really are foolish.

70
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,617
You just don't get it, do you?

71
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,277
What did Mura say to you?

72
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,488
Why do you look so serious?

73
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,662
Let's eat.

74
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
It's almost dinnertime.

75
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,546
It's pretty amazing that you guys always
show up right around dinnertime.

76
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,427
Gosh, it's gone bad.

77
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,554
What should we do?

78
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,681
Should we have cup noodles?

79
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,475
What did Mura...

80
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,186
say to you?

81
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,483
She didn't say much.
She just told me your old love story.

82
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,235
It wasn't even that interesting.

83
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,195
Sit down.

84
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,614
-Nak-bin was--
-Yes, Nak-bin.

85
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,325
That was her name, right?

86
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,996
I knew it. The story about the woman
with the surname Shim was fake.

87
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,459
The woman, whom you loved so dearly,

88
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,294
betrayed you,

89
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,087
and she was punished eventually.

90
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,175
Then her brother made a stupid pledge.
And, apparently, he's my ancestor.

91
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,387
But the thing is,
am I supposed to be responsible

92
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,349
for what one of my ancestors did
1,200 years ago?

93
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,184
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

94
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,728
I'm utterly baffled.

95
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,941
What is it that you really want to say?

96
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,192
Go back.

97
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,696
Return to where you belong.

98
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,824
Please go back.

99
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,750
And please move out as soon as possible.

100
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,711
I decide when I will leave.

101
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,881
I heard you did nothing.

102
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,930
<i>Do whatever it takes to persuade him.</i>

103
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,182
When the woman you loved...

104
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,560
was dying,

105
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,312
you did nothing.

106
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,333
<i>You really are foolish.</i>

107
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,836
<i>You just don't get it, do you?</i>

108
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,755
I'm not telling you to feel guilty.

109
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,967
I'm asking you to let Habaek go.

110
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,137
Let him go.

111
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,306
I know you can figure out
that is what you should do.

112
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,351
It makes me so angry to admit this,

113
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,228
but I have to.

114
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,233
That fool...

115
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,320
is in love with you.

116
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,530
Do you understand?

117
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,493
He'll go back anyway.

118
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,494
But he's torn.

119
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,248
He can't only think about himself.

120
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,500
Habaek represents the Land of Water,

121
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,502
which is everything to him.

122
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,339
Like you said,
he has to go back eventually.

123
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,009
Do you know what the biggest irony is?

124
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,470
If he doesn't ascend the throne,

125
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
he'll be nothing.

126
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:38,437
That means Habaek will choose to go back,
no matter how torn he is now.

127
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,106
Then everything is fine.

128
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,567
Let him go before he destroys himself...

129
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,154
while he still has the strength
to get over it.

130
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,531
Let him go, please.

131
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,286
After losing Nak-bin,

132
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,957
he punished himself and became a wreck.

133
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,708
I don't want to see that again.

134
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,298
I beg you.

135
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,884
Please don't hold him back,

136
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,387
like Nak-bin did.

137
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,978
I wish I could cry.

138
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,232
Like you said,

139
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,736
I wish I could get drunk.

140
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,949
I wish I could do...

141
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,660
all those stupid things that humans do.

142
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,124
I'm so angry.

143
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,085
This anger is driving me nuts.

144
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,880
I admitted in front of her

145
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,133
that he's in love with her.

146
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,551
You didn't have to.

147
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,429
Why did that have to be...

148
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,140
the only way I could send him back?

149
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,979
Then you did what you had to do.

150
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,649
You don't need to be angry...

151
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,985
or regret anything.

152
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,822
I'll give you a hug.

153
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,206
If you'd let me,

154
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,960
I could beat Habaek to a pulp.

155
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,422
Don't you dare.

156
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,761
See? I knew you'd say that.

157
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,168
Namsuri.

158
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,464
Wake up, Namsuri.

159
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,263
-Where were you yesterday?
-Here and there.

160
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,308
Were your feelings hurt because I worked
to get a gift for the servant?

161
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,602
Pardon? Oh, well...

162
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,562
Yes, it really hurt my feelings.

163
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,984
I'm sorry.

164
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,488
You drive the duck boat
during the day in the scorching heat

165
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,157
and work as a delivery guy at night
while battling mosquitoes.

166
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,326
I know you're doing all of that
to serve me well.

167
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,081
Even though I'm strong and healthy,
all I do is take warm baths

168
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,251
and enjoy the food, books,
and fruit juice you get me.

169
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,169
All I do is eat and drink.

170
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,672
I'm well aware of it.

171
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,133
No! Please forgive me
for my grave sins, My Lord!

172
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,972
You weren't actually expecting me
to say such things, were you?

173
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,100
No, My Lord.

174
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,935
Then go tell the servant...

175
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,689
that we should have breakfast.

176
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,441
Pardon? Sure, right away.

177
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,874
That was a good meal.

178
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,671
Give me your phone.

179
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,806
Take care of them for us.

180
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,143
I heard that the service
needs to be canceled.

181
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,939
The newspaper too.

182
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,859
Please also get rid of
my clothes and books.

183
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,819
What do you mean, My Lord?

184
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,531
Also, call Namsuri's boss
at the duck boat tour company for him.

185
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,744
Don't stay out late.

186
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,290
I heard there's a type of light

187
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,375
that turns on automatically
when it gets dark.

188
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,420
Get it for your door.

189
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,924
And don't eat cup noodles all the time.

190
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,428
Make yourself proper meals,
even if you're not a good cook.

191
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,432
Also, don't clean the house
once every million years.

192
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,061
Try to clean often.

193
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,356
It'll be easier that way.

194
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,984
For the streetlight in the alley,

195
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,696
I heard you can submit a complaint
when it's not working.

196
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,451
Even if it feels a hassle,
it's better than walking in the dark.

197
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,538
Just submit a complaint.

198
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,250
You enjoy doing things like that anyway.

199
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,591
Well...

200
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,302
-Namsuri.
-Yes?

201
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,637
Give us some privacy.

202
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:10,931
Sure.

203
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,572
I told you that it shows on your face
when you lie. Do you remember?

204
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,453
But this time, I couldn't tell.

205
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,251
I've realized
that you truly want me to leave.

206
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,505
I told you that I'm your god...

207
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,092
and bluffed that I'd protect you.

208
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,095
It embarrasses me.

209
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,975
Why did I make a promise
that I cannot keep?

210
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,560
I regret it.

211
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,480
I want to ask you if I can leave...

212
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,733
and if you'll be okay.

213
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,696
I want to ask you how you really feel,

214
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,244
but you'll probably be okay
because I've done nothing for you.

215
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,378
I'll be fine.

216
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,509
Like you said yourself,
you've done nothing for me.

217
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,764
Your absence won't even be noticeable.

218
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,226
I'll be a bit lonely, but I'll be fine.

219
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,898
I've told you. I'm good at enduring things
because I'm lesser.

220
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,445
All right, then.

221
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,825
-Are you going to leave today?
-I'm leaving now.

222
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,330
Then I'll give you a ride
to Gangwon Province.

223
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,372
No, it's okay.

224
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,877
Let's just part ways here.

225
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,822
Let's go, Namsuri.

226
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,825
Yes, My Lord.

227
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,917
Take care, Ms. Descendant.

228
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,840
Lord Judong told me
to wait for him, though.

229
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,094
<i>Goodbye.</i>

230
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,460
<i>Farewell.</i>

231
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,384
<i>You need a stand-in for a reporter?</i>

232
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,638
What's it about?

233
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,057
The sailfin...

234
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,017
Catching the sailfin sandfish?

235
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,562
The thing is,
I'm prone to severe seasickness.

236
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,191
I can't really be on a small fishing boat.
That's right.

237
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,777
<i>You don't want to do it?</i>

238
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,820
No, it's not that.

239
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,405
<i>Gosh, I'm so disappointed.</i>

240
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,325
Okay, I'll do it.

241
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,953
But you have to make sure
I look very pretty in it.

242
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,874
All right.
Then I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

243
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,879
-What?
-Tell him you don't want to do it.

244
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,047
What do you know?

245
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,841
If I'm that choosy, I'll never be able
to make a name for myself.

246
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,260
-Give me your phone.
-Hey, what are you doing now?

247
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,180
-<i>Hey, Ja-ya.</i>
-Hello.

248
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,349
I'm Ja-ya's manager.
You can call me Mr. Min.

249
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,267
-<i>All right. What can I do for you?</i>
-Mr. Gwon.

250
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,852
If Ja-ya gets on the boat,

251
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,480
you'll need to clean it right away.
Will you be okay with that?

252
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,023
-<i>I have to clean it?</i>
-That's right.

253
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,608
She'll throw up.

254
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,568
She'll vomit nonstop.

255
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,570
Forget catching fish.

256
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,198
You'll have to turn the boat around.
She won't be able to function.

257
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:21,950
<i>Let's cancel it, then.</i>

258
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,992
You want to cancel it?

259
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,370
Sorry for the inconvenience.

260
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,664
Let us know
if there's another good opportunity.

261
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,581
Thanks.

262
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,293
-It's been canceled.
-What?

263
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,713
Okay, thanks.

264
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,799
I have to deliver some juice,
so I should get going.

265
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,354
Stay still.

266
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,067
I told you to stay still!

267
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,403
What's wrong? Is it acting up?

268
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,990
Shall I get you a new one?
A mannequin, perhaps?

269
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,827
How about something
that looks like Brad Pitt?

270
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,458
Does such a thing actually exist?

271
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,625
Yes, of course.

272
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,502
I know you like handsome guys.

273
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,548
Maybe that one isn't working
because it's simply not your type.

274
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,511
Then should we try that?
Although I don't love the idea.

275
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,015
Why are you laughing?

276
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,311
Well, do you really believe...

277
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,313
that will solve the problem?

278
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,607
The problem is you, you bonehead.

279
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,659
There's nothing wrong with the actors.

280
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,036
The problem is you.

281
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,122
You scare them when you should be
making them fall in love with you.

282
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,210
I will freeze your tongue and--

283
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,008
All right.
Let's say your co-star did this.

284
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,428
"Don't you dare kiss me.

285
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,889
If you do,
I'll freeze your tongue and crush it."

286
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,392
If that was the message he got,
would he want to kiss you?

287
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,687
What...

288
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,327
Good. That's how you do it. Okay?

289
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,081
Close your mouth.
You're not shooting an adult movie.

290
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,296
I've been cutting you too much slack
these days.

291
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,597
Let me know whenever you need
someone to practice with.

292
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,391
I'd be better than a mannequin.

293
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,150
Yes.

294
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,028
Fine.

295
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,781
I'll do it. I said, I'll do it!

296
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,872
Has the kissing scene been scheduled?

297
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,210
The penalty won't do, right?

298
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,796
Humans are like that.

299
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,967
When their pride is hurt,
even money can't do anything.

300
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,887
I mean, look at So-a.

301
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,764
She returned the car
as soon as Habaek left.

302
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,101
How's she holding up?

303
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,605
My gosh! Stop right there.

304
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,483
He's such a happy, energetic kid.

305
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,029
Oh, you dropped it.
Good job. You're so adorable.

306
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,281
All right, let's go over there.

307
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,413
What an innocent little munchkin.

308
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,123
I'm really sorry.

309
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,001
No problem. He has such a pure soul.

310
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,128
-Take care.
-Bye.

311
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,047
Bye. See you.

312
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,298
Get home safely.

313
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,008
My goodness.

314
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,471
-He's so cute.
-Why are you so chipper?

315
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,014
I'm totally frazzled.

316
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,141
Isn't he cute?

317
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,935
You're so negative about everything.

318
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,521
That little boy is full of energy.

319
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,984
I got a call from the bank
to say we're eligible for the loan.

320
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,111
It's all thanks to Mr. Ma's father.

321
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,281
Really? That's such great news.

322
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,116
Contact Mr. Bang
as soon as we receive the money.

323
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,952
Did you tell him we'll pay more deposit?

324
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,288
Yes, I did. The contract has
already expired, but he said he'd wait.

325
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,042
Great, perfect. So many good things
are happening. We even have more patients.

326
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,669
We just have one new patient.

327
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,837
Why are you so hyper these days?

328
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,799
Why are you so negative about everything?

329
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,927
Isn't that mine?

330
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,221
Yes. I saw that you have a lot of this,

331
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,347
so I took a few.

332
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,599
I want to start taking some supplements
for my health.

333
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,810
I should put my health
before anything else.

334
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,187
I have to stay healthy
if I want to go to Vanuatu.

335
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,439
Then buy some for yourself.
Why steal mine?

336
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,942
What? I stole yours?

337
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,237
Hey, why are you so obsessed with these?

338
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,572
It's because Mr. Ma got them for me.

339
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,616
Get out.

340
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,202
Dr. Yun.

341
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,705
So-a, did you ask Ji-won
to set you up with someone?

342
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,415
-Yes.
-What?

343
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,875
Why is she telling everyone?

344
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,837
Oh, right. I told her to tell everyone.
I'm so forgetful. Oh, dear.

345
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,131
My goodness!

346
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,717
I'm sorry, guys.

347
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,806
Why are you so shocked
that I'm going on a blind date?

348
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,726
Hey, I'm totally fine.

349
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,228
I knew it. It's really no big deal.

350
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,481
I thought I'd be devastated,
but not at all.

351
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,318
Had I known it'd be this easy,
I would've had more fun with him.

352
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,445
Too bad.

353
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,866
You don't get it?

354
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,827
Do you know why there usually isn't
much romance in crime dramas?

355
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,495
It's because they're too busy.

356
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,414
They have too many urgent problems
to deal with.

357
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:05,543
They're so busy solving problems
that they don't have time for romance.

358
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,628
Do you see what I'm getting at?

359
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,216
If I were to categorize my life under
one genre, it wouldn't be romance.

360
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,263
-What I'm trying to say is--
-I heard you!

361
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,015
I get it.

362
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,601
You're embarrassing me.

363
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,603
I'm so happy that you two broke up.

364
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,273
But I can't really say this is better
than you crying your eyes out.

365
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,818
Why? I'm a psychiatrist too.

366
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,071
Also, romance is considered
a genre as well, okay?

367
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,155
But you're a quack.

368
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,494
You always bragged about having a knack
for enduring pain.

369
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,081
I have to get back to work.
I'm expecting a patient.

370
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,298
I have to say,
I'm disappointed in Namsuri as well.

371
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,094
I should've just made a move.

372
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,602
She said it wouldn't take long,
so she'll be back shortly.

373
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,145
Okay.

374
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:07,939
Well...

375
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,109
You don't need to worry about me.

376
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,112
When Dr. Yun finds a good partner,

377
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,115
I'll be on my way.
I should get married too, you know.

378
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,574
All right.

379
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,496
The irony is that she has many
emotional wounds because of us.

380
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,083
Her father was always too busy
taking care of us.

381
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,919
It is true that
he was more attentive to us,

382
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,879
and she was bullied in school
on top of that.

383
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,382
I even saw kids telling her to get lost,

384
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,967
saying she smells like a beggar.

385
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,513
She hasn't told you any of this yet?

386
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,852
I'm sorry. I thought
she had already told you everything.

387
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,146
Be nicer to her, please.

388
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,565
You should dissuade her
from going on that blind date.

389
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,235
Dr. Yun is going on a blind date?

390
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,411
Oh, you're already here.

391
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,594
It's too late for me to apologize

392
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,679
for what happened last time, right?

393
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,391
It's okay. I should apologize too.

394
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,685
I scared you, didn't I?

395
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,105
Did you have a bad dream or something?

396
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,443
-Yes.
-Is it related to your sleep disorder?

397
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,111
Yes.

398
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:41,157
As I've said before, you should try
to think about something else.

399
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,491
But I know it's not easy.

400
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,620
Then why don't we try this?

401
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,081
You said you experienced something
that reminded you of your past.

402
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,792
Could you tell me about it?

403
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,300
Will this be too hard as well?

404
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,637
I met people
whose paths I never wanted to cross.

405
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,472
Who are they?

406
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,641
They want to lock me up in my past.

407
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,310
-Could you please elaborate?
-They criticize me.

408
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,146
They remind me of...

409
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,732
my past.

410
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,490
Your unhappy past...
is not something to be criticized.

411
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,285
No one can decide
exactly how their life will unfold.

412
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,123
Is there something else?

413
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,006
Do you not want to talk about it today?

414
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,302
Then there's nothing we can do today.

415
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,930
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

416
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,598
It looks like you need more time.

417
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,351
But you know what?

418
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,771
You need to trust me more.

419
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,364
Let's have dinner together.

420
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,199
Sorry?

421
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,038
I don't spend time with my patients
outside of the clinic--

422
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,250
Don't read too much into it.
Just have dinner with me.

423
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,252
Otherwise, we'll both have to eat alone.

424
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,055
We never get hungry. Why do you want
to eat at mealtimes like humans do?

425
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,100
"Life itself is the proper binge,"

426
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,311
said a human called Julia something.

427
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,770
But we're not human.

428
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,190
You said you wanted to do
all the lame things that humans do.

429
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,320
I'm still angry. Do you know that?

430
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,573
-Sorry?
-There are still hard feelings.

431
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,410
I just wanted to have dinner with you.
Why did you push me away?

432
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,329
Well, I was just...

433
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,709
How do you form a friendship, Dr. Yun?

434
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,670
-Pardon?
-You know what?

435
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,465
I know all about your financial situation,

436
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,175
and I also know how to push your buttons.

437
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,385
I know how thoughtful you are,

438
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,180
and you're also very considerate,
even though you act like you're not.

439
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,057
You'd rather bear losses yourself.

440
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,434
I know that enduring things
is your hobby and specialty.

441
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,602
I also know who you like

442
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,228
and why you're heartbroken.

443
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,065
I learned about your childhood too.

444
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,233
I know your address
and resident registration number.

445
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,278
Oh, sorry. I have a photographic memory.

446
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,948
It's not like I stalked you
to obtain all this information.

447
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,658
You told me everything yourself.

448
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,036
You also know a lot about me.

449
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,746
You've consoled and encouraged me.

450
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,459
Now, how can friendship grow from here?

451
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,339
Are you saying we should become friends?

452
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,050
Don't you think we can be friends now?

453
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,678
I'm rich. I also have a healthy mindset.

454
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,931
I'm commonsensical, polite,
hardworking, and handsome.

455
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,225
I even grow trees.
I think I'm pretty awesome.

456
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,896
This is starting to hurt my pride.

457
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,567
It's not like I'm asking you to marry me.
All I want is friendship.

458
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,612
Do I really have to list
all of these things?

459
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,799
Don't make a scene. Let's just leave.

460
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,018
There's a restaurant I know.
Let's go there.

461
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,187
Jingeon, take her home.

462
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,291
Do you really not know
why he's being like that?

463
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,585
That can't be.

464
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,130
You know, don't you?

465
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,385
Why is it that you never talk?

466
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,392
Let's go. Come on.

467
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:26,108
Do you know
that I'm still a little mad at you?

468
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,401
What?

469
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,279
The hard feelings are still there.

470
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,907
I'm quite picky too.

471
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,243
It's not like I ask everyone
to be my friend.

472
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,412
I'm sorry.

473
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,998
You really hold a grudge, don't you?

474
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,125
Then I have to say something too.

475
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,169
You want us to be friends,
yet you can't trust me.

476
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,548
I'm your psychiatrist and friend,
but your sessions are going nowhere.

477
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,883
How do you explain it?

478
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,761
Is it because you can't trust me
as a psychiatrist?

479
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,680
-No, that's not why.
-Okay.

480
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,683
I can't force you to trust me.
I'll make more effort instead.

481
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,693
And this plush toy is so cute.

482
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,321
I have to go.

483
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,798
Can I take that?

484
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,926
Isn't it cute?
My friend and I designed it together.

485
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,137
It came with cups as a set,
but all the cups have been sold.

486
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,847
-How much--
-I'll pay.

487
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,520
What are you doing? I'm getting you a gift
to celebrate our friendship.

488
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,357
I'm too old to get a plush toy as a gift.

489
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,527
-How much is it?
-It's 45,000 won.

490
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,494
Hello?

491
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,748
Okay. I'll leave right away.

492
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,257
It looks like I should get going.
Something came up at the hotel.

493
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,759
I had a great time today.

494
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,804
I'm sorry I can't drive you home.

495
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,639
Get home safely. I'll see you soon.

496
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:05,684
HABAEK
YUN SO-A

497
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,980
What is this place?

498
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,024
<i>-Don't you remember?</i>
<i>-Remember what?</i>

499
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,263
<i>Why are you reading it silently?</i>
<i>You're mean.</i>

500
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,058
You can't even read
the first sentence aloud for me?

501
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,270
I'll tell you to stop reading
if I don't like what I hear.

502
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,150
I know it's embarrassing
to read something out loud.

503
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,904
"How did we meet?

504
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,868
One day, a butterfly flew like a petal

505
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,953
and made a small flutter."

506
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,917
<i>Once, I read the page of the book</i>
<i>you used to read aloud to myself.</i>

507
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,253
<i>Once, I sat on the chair</i>
<i>you used to sit on</i>

508
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,465
<i>and closed my eyes</i>

509
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,051
<i>in order to feel your warmth.</i>

510
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:49,223
<i>Once, I even caressed the rim</i>
<i>of the cup you used to use</i>

511
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,351
<i>with my fingertips.</i>

512
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,478
"How did we...

513
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,899
manage to come this far together?

514
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,110
Were we able to reach love

515
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,280
because we walked through
such lovely moments together?

516
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,159
<i>-An inevitable miracle."</i>
<i>-"An inevitable miracle.</i>

517
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,122
<i>I suppose I didn't want to think...</i>

518
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,001
<i>that we met by a mere coincidence.</i>

519
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,338
<i>So,</i>

520
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:26,468
<i>the only thing I can do is do my best..."</i>

521
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,428
You can stop reading. Let's go eat now.

522
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,139
I'll read the rest myself.

523
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,894
<i>"...to love you.</i>

524
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,273
<i>At the moment,</i>

525
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,277
<i>I am passing through your love."</i>

526
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,497
<i>Why can't you do it for me?</i>

527
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,958
I want to keep coming here,

528
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,419
so you can just prepare
the medication yourself.

529
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,089
Why did he have to complain
about such a thing?

530
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,675
Mr. Shin called earlier

531
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,428
and suggested sending the employees here
directly from now on.

532
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,348
-That would be nice.
-See?

533
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,392
He's the only one who understands you.

534
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,144
How does the afternoon look?

535
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,729
You have one appointment with Mr. Ma.

536
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,781
You said you were okay.

537
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,492
But you don't seem okay at all.

538
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,334
You kept talking about
the winners, lessers, and losers.

539
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,836
You kept bringing up
that pretentious nonsense,

540
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,129
and look at you now.

541
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,132
You seem as though
you drank way more than you can handle.

542
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,386
It looks like
you're still struggling to sober up.

543
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,054
That's obviously not the case

544
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,015
-because I'm the one who dumped you.
-You did.

545
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,476
But it doesn't feel like it, does it?

546
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,272
You're probably hating me
for not being able to spot your lies.

547
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,443
Do you realize it now?

548
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,655
It's impossible to not hurt anyone.

549
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,118
Just like how the one who's loved
by everyone is the worst person.

550
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,167
I mean, think about that mysterious number
you went on about.

551
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,295
A lot of people

552
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,132
live certain moments as if that day
is going to be their last day.

553
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,886
They instinctively know that they must
live today in order to see tomorrow.

554
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:19,224
They don't live in fear that tomorrow
may not be the same as today.

555
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,893
I'm talking about those
who believe they can live

556
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,689
the rest of their lives with the memories
they've collected today.

557
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,901
Isn't that much wiser
than looking for an imaginary number

558
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,945
to prevent everyone from getting hurt?

559
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:37,242
You said the square of an imaginary number
ends up being less than zero.

560
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,458
You're not even human.

561
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,442
How come you never have an umbrella?
You'll go bald.

562
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,698
What?

563
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,589
I guess she's still in love
with that water demon.

564
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,008
Goodness.

565
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,477
-<i>What's up?</i>
-Come see me if you have some time.

566
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:46,853
Yes.

567
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,064
Habaek left.

568
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,568
Did our servant tell you?

569
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,654
What a funny woman.

570
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,323
What did she want in exchange?

571
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,825
Consolation? An alternative?

572
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,284
I wouldn't be asking you...

573
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,537
if I heard it from Ms. Yun.

574
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,541
Fine. I came because
I also have something to say.

575
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,841
Please take care of her. No, actually...

576
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,803
Yes.

577
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,223
Just make her yours. You can have her.

578
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,186
A divine servant, my foot.

579
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,897
We don't need her.
We don't even care, but...

580
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,484
This is just so annoying.

581
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,113
I'm not obsessed with being seen
as the nice one.

582
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,829
-Are you trying to be responsible?
-No, it's not that.

583
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,374
You may not believe me,

584
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,003
but I don't think humans deserve
to become miserable because of gods.

585
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,173
-So--
-Then shouldn't you tell me...

586
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,679
to make her happy...

587
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,391
rather than tell me to just have her?

588
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:13,190
I don't care what you do.
Just help her forget Habaek.

589
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,900
That's not something I can easily do.

590
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,067
Give it a try.

591
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,236
You were planning on doing that anyway.

592
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,950
And I want you to marry her.
Stay by her side until the day she dies.

593
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:28,330
Make sure no other man
can even think about being with her.

594
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,917
That's the only way we can
completely cut off ties with her.

595
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,296
This must end for her own sake.

596
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,591
I want you...

597
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,259
to help her.

598
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,811
What is it now?

599
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,898
You scared me.
Why do you always show up so quietly...

600
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,068
and startle me?

601
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,531
-Well, how much do you get paid monthly?
-Why do you ask?

602
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,575
I'll pay you 1.5 times your wage
to become my manager.

603
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,036
Really? I don't need that money.

604
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,371
I'll make it double.

605
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,667
All right, okay. Sit down.

606
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,879
Then just keep being a good friend
like you've always been.

607
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,757
Do you really want counseling from me?

608
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,884
Are you being serious?

609
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,303
You said you'll do it if I pay you.

610
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,764
If you're serious, there's something
you need to do first.

611
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,224
What's that?

612
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,394
-Use honorifics when you call me.
-What?

613
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,646
My gosh.

614
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,525
What kind of nonsense is that?

615
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,693
You don't want to do it?

616
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,236
Forget it, then.

617
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:48,410
Wait. Hey, how old are you?

618
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,495
From what I understand,
we're the same age.

619
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,707
Then I can't use honorifics.
I was born in January.

620
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,670
I was born on January 1, at 12:01 a.m.

621
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,715
-But why?
-What do you mean?

622
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,300
You don't want counseling?

623
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,385
Forget it, then.

624
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,429
Sir!

625
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,101
Fine, I'll talk to you politely
from now on.

626
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:18,023
Good. What is it that you want
to talk to me about?

627
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:26,114
You didn't give me proper advice
on what happened last time.

628
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,283
Why do you think
Mr. Shin hugged me from behind?

629
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,243
I wasn't mistaken.

630
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,829
He keeps acting like a bad guy.

631
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,416
Now that we've decided
to do this properly,

632
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,543
I'll be responsible
and give you proper advice.

633
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:43,298
From what I understand, he's in love
with your friend, Ms. Yun So-a.

634
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,343
So just drink some ice-cold water
and come to your senses.

635
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,055
-What?
-Now, it's crystal clear, right?

636
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,141
This is why all the girls at church
always ask me for advice.

637
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,402
Grandpa, kick her out of your building.
Kick her out right now!

638
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,613
You can't kick her out?

639
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,908
If you don't, I'll move back to the US.
I'll go live with Mom!

640
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,868
I'm going to leave you!

641
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,958
Why did you ask me to come by? I'm busy.

642
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,339
Go back outside and come in again.

643
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,548
What?

644
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,176
Why?

645
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,894
My gosh, I don't even know.
I should've just gone for it back then.

646
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,939
What are you saying?
Why did you want to see me?

647
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,315
Have we done a birth chart reading?

648
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,734
-Tell me your date and time of birth.
-Gosh, don't bother.

649
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,153
Just tell me. It's because
you keep appearing in my dreams.

650
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,825
I was born on-- Just a second.

651
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,785
Who's calling?

652
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,746
What's up? Is a patient waiting?

653
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,248
<i>Dr. Yun!</i>

654
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,125
What? What's wrong?

655
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,211
-Just take it out.
-Please leave it there.

656
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,504
-Just do as I say!
-Gosh!

657
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,548
What is happening?

658
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,677
"The contract ended a long time ago.

659
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,388
I can't let this go on.
I won't put up with this anymore!"

660
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,015
That's what the chairman said.

661
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,145
"I'm an old man who lives off
the rental income from this building.

662
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:25,442
My safety is being threatened
because of that evil tenant."

663
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,402
Those were also his words.

664
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:31,030
What are you talking about?
I said I'll pay more deposit.

665
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,991
Didn't you tell him?

666
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,910
I did, but he suddenly wants us
out of here today no matter what.

667
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,829
Just leave it there!

668
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,414
What kind of nonsense is this?

669
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,874
Just leave that there, please!

670
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,584
By the way, I heard that

671
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,087
this was all decided by
the chairman's beloved granddaughter,

672
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,839
Ms. Shin Ja-ya,

673
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,758
who is the real power behind the throne.

674
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,010
Ms. Shin Ja-ya.

675
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:52,927
What?

676
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,054
What did you say? Shin Ja-ya?

677
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,059
Take your filthy hands off everything.

678
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,812
Mr. Ma.

679
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,614
Put everything back where it was.
Don't move anything.

680
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,949
Hey, you! Put that down.

681
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,411
Mr. Ma, it's okay. It's nothing serious.

682
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,955
Don't get worked up.
Just wait outside, please.

683
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,707
Don't touch anything.

684
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,418
Who says you can
kick her out of this building?

685
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,588
I told you not to touch anything!

686
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,799
-What is your problem?
-I told you not to touch anything!

687
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,471
-Mr. Ma!
-Don't touch anything!

688
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,350
-Mr. Ma, stop!
-Calm down!

689
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,313
-Mr. Ma!
-You bastard!

690
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,566
Get out!

691
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,867
Be quiet!

692
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,828
He's my patient.

693
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,289
He has trouble controlling his emotions.

694
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,250
I'm his psychiatrist.
I'll take responsibility.

695
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,459
Please let him go and--

696
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,962
We haven't been able to do anything
because he's going bonkers.

697
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,505
How can we let him go?

698
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,882
Let's talk when his guardian gets here.

699
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,217
Excuse me, Officer.

700
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,928
I didn't even punch him once.

701
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,597
That guy also participated in the assault,

702
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,558
so they'll both have to come
to an agreement.

703
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,644
His guardian is out of the country
at the moment.

704
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,063
It'll take some time
for someone else to come.

705
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,233
Don't shut down my psychiatrist's clinic!
How could anyone with a heart do this?

706
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,360
You heartless bastard! You're--

707
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,820
Please be quiet!

708
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,114
Ms. Yun.

709
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,868
Mr. Shin, I'm here!

710
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,080
-We're okay now.
-Hello.

711
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,797
Don't worry about these two.
You should just...

712
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,801
focus on dealing with the aftermath.
Thank you.

713
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,011
I'll call you later.

714
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,689
-May I hold your arm?
-Pardon?

715
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,983
You look like you're about to collapse.

716
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,029
I'm all right.

717
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,742
Why did Sang-yu do such a useless thing?

718
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,036
It's not useless. I'm so glad he did it.

719
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,621
Give him a raise.

720
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,791
I laughed a little after I got your call.

721
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,712
I realized you probably don't have
that many friends, just like me.

722
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,174
Why did you have to be so difficult
when I asked you to be my friend?

723
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,427
What do you say now?
Isn't it nice to have a rich friend?

724
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,806
Do you want something to drink?

725
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,101
-I just want to go home and rest.
-All right, then.

726
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,354
Get in. I'll drive you home.

727
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,483
It's not too far from here.
I'll just walk.

728
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,110
The cool breeze will help me
recollect myself.

729
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,070
Okay.

730
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,031
Then I'll call you later
to make sure you got home safely.

731
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,950
Thank you so much for today.

732
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,871
Get home safely.

733
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,918
MR. SHIN HU-YE

734
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,212
Hello?

735
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,589
<i>Are you home yet?</i>

736
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,341
No, not yet.

737
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,801
<i>I knew it.</i>

738
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,469
<i>You said it's not far.</i>

739
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,138
I'm walking slowly.

740
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:10,560
<i>Then I'll have to call you again</i>
<i>to make sure you got home safely.</i>

741
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,150
<i>I recently found out</i>
<i>that the granddaughter</i>

742
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,402
<i>of the building owner is a girl</i>
<i>who hated me in school.</i>

743
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,072
<i>I don't even care to know</i>
<i>what she's up to.</i>

744
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,616
<i>I wonder why she hates me so much.</i>

745
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,285
We have a lot in common.

746
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:28,911
Pardon?

747
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,330
<i>I'm also suffering</i>
<i>because of those kinds of people.</i>

748
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,375
What will you do about the clinic?

749
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,254
I'll either have to meet the landlord
and beg him to change his mind

750
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,132
or go see his granddaughter

751
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,760
and beg her instead, I guess.

752
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,219
Do you want me to go with you?

753
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,555
I'm pretty good at threatening people.

754
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,015
What?

755
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,392
<i>Or should I just buy that building?</i>

756
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,519
I mean, I'm pretty rich myself.

757
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,232
<i>I'm being serious.</i>

758
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,557
I told you not to stay out late.

759
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,352
You never listen to me, do you?

760
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,404
<i>Habaek is back.</i>

761
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,614
<i>I came to say goodbye properly.</i>

762
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:52,990
<i>I want to love you with no regrets.</i>

763
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,243
<i>She is Habaek's woman.</i>
<i>I was one step too late.</i>

764
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,703
<i>The war begins now.</i>

765
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,330
<i>If you can't win her heart,</i>

766
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,374
<i>just take it by force.</i>

767
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,834
<i>Why do you keep acting like</i>
<i>you don't know how I feel about you?</i>

768
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,252
<i>Is this real? Or am I dreaming?</i>

769
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,505
<i>If this is a dream,</i>
<i>I hope I never wake up.</i>

770
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,924
<i>I'll wait. I'm good at waiting.</i>

771
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,801
<i>Get away from him! I can't stand this.</i>

772
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,511
<i>-Have you forgotten?</i>
<i>-No way.</i>

773
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:16,055
<i>-I'm capable of...</i>
<i>-I thought I was mistaken.</i>

774
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,306
<i>...killing you guys.</i>
