1
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,911
She will die young.

2
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,372
Before Lord Habaek comes back
and takes the throne,

3
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,459
she will die.

4
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,673
I shall grace you with my blessing,

5
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,967
so wake up already.

6
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,975
You...

7
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,353
You now belong to the gods

8
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,273
Accept your fate,
or you'll go through everything.

9
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,650
How do you feel now?

10
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:53,029
Don't you feel like something
in your heart is smacking your head?

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,365
You should feel honored...

12
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,409
to receive the kiss of a god.

13
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,427
-What are you doing?
-You crazy jerk!

14
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,181
I knew it. It didn't wake her.

15
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,226
See? I told you she'd be mad.

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,145
Go fix this.

17
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,357
Are you scared?

18
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,401
Fine.

19
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,320
I'll do it for you just this once.

20
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,655
No way.

21
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,825
You've been saying that a lot
since you arrived here.

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,205
Who do you think you are talking to?

23
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,293
You shouldn't kiss a woman like that
out of nowhere.

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,378
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,089
It didn't wake her. If you go now,
she'll slap you in the face.

26
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,049
My gosh.

27
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,104
I must have been out of my mind.

28
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,648
I must have gone crazy.

29
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,074
Why did I close my eyes?

30
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,536
I have to find a logical reason
for closing my eyes.

31
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,457
Right. To avoid trauma...

32
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,876
To avoid trauma,

33
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,253
I have to find a reason.

34
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,715
Face it and overcome.

35
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,966
<i>Hey, you. Servant.</i>

36
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,442
No. Don't do it.

37
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,319
No!

38
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:02,659
<i>Don't you feel like something</i>
<i>in your heart is smacking your head?</i>

39
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,495
-Absolutely not.
-<i>I'm pretty sure I'm right.</i>

40
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,316
You're wrong.

41
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,030
Stay away!

42
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,309
You shouldn't kiss a woman like that
out of nowhere.

43
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,228
If you go now,
she'll slap you in the face.

44
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,944
She must be very stupid
to not realize that she was blessed.

45
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,823
I'm hungry.

46
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm very hungry.

47
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,629
I've had enough of stupid servants.

48
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,719
No, you're wrong about this.

49
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,930
She'll be awakened
and she'll come and find me.

50
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,864
It's nothing.

51
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,743
It's because the world has changed.

52
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,870
Stupid Sang-yu didn't even
call me to wake me up.

53
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,039
My stomach...

54
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,127
<i>It's Sunday. You're probably</i>
<i>swearing at me, aren't you?</i>

55
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,837
<i>It's Sunday.</i>

56
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,047
<i>It's Sunday. You're probably</i>
<i>swearing at me, aren't you?</i>

57
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,801
<i>-It's Sunday.</i>
-Right.

58
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,678
<i>It's Sunday. You're probably--</i>

59
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,890
Right, it's Sunday.

60
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,144
<i>You're probably back in bed,</i>
<i>aren't you? Get up.</i>

61
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,105
-<i>You're in bed again. Get up now.</i>
-Enough.

62
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,239
<i>Go exercise.</i>

63
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,241
Stop it already.

64
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,911
<i>Get photosynthesized.</i>

65
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,079
<i>Vitamin D is important for women.</i>

66
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,128
<i>Strong thighs will help you avoid</i>
<i>getting diabetes when you are old.</i>

67
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,880
<i>Strong thighs will help you avoid--</i>

68
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,801
Dear God! I'd rather kill Yu Sang-yu
and go to hell.

69
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,306
Why are there so many humans today?

70
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,443
Move. You're blocking my way.

71
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,335
It's called a bicycle.
It's a form of transportation for humans.

72
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,672
A cycle? Why are there only two wheels?

73
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,757
How can they ride it and not fall?

74
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,509
That's because...

75
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,598
Do you want to see other wheels?

76
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,333
Isn't it so cool?

77
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,168
Not really.

78
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,837
Not all things with four wheels
are equally fun.

79
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,133
Since when does he know
how it feels to ride on wheels?

80
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,306
So? What do you want me to do here?

81
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,352
There he goes again!

82
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,270
Nice. My gosh!

83
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,193
Awesome. That was great.

84
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,573
Amazing! He even did an ollie.

85
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,911
As you just saw, there's such
a wide variety of skateboarding tricks.

86
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,790
The person who can do all of
the four tricks we just showed you

87
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,626
will unquestionably
become the first-place winner.

88
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,922
Great.

89
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,924
I should've just stayed home.

90
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,928
Why are there so many people here?
It's annoying.

91
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,055
Best of luck. You got this.

92
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,807
You look so cool!

93
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,100
What's that?

94
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,105
What's going on?

95
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,856
Here goes the first contestant.

96
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,608
The blond lady. So far so good.

97
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,986
Oh, no! Too bad. She's been disqualified.

98
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,905
The second contestant, please proceed.

99
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,824
Gosh, that's great! You're doing awesome!

100
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,866
My gosh, he's--

101
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,784
Oh, no.

102
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,286
The third contestant, please come on out.

103
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,122
I think he'll be great.

104
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,416
Oh, my! Amazing!

105
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,335
Just this once. Please? Just one time.

106
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
-The fourth contestant...
-You want to go back

107
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,256
-to being a fish again?
-I think he'll be good.

108
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,507
He may be a dark horse.

109
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,051
We don't know how long
we might end up having to stay here.

110
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,803
-Go!
-I told you

111
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,930
that we need money to live here.

112
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,433
-He didn't make it.
-Lord Habaek, please.

113
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,810
That's too bad. He was so close.

114
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,603
The fifth contestant, please come on out.

115
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,148
-Please, My Lord.
-The fifth contestant?

116
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,275
Are you giving up?

117
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,945
I get it.
It must be extremely nerve-racking.

118
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,282
-Who is it?
-Why isn't he coming out?

119
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,249
Will the one who can do
all four tricks come in first place?

120
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,334
Be gentle. Please take it easy.

121
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,794
FIRST PLACE PRIZE: 100,000 WON

122
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,172
What must I do if I want to win
all three prizes?

123
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,716
-Pardon me?
-You'll have to give me everything.

124
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,803
Know that this is a huge honor.

125
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,930
-What?
-What's he saying?

126
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,649
-Excuse me, sir.
-Goodness.

127
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,193
You must be extremely nervous now.

128
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,487
You're going the wrong way.
You have to come here.

129
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,113
What?

130
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,012
Lord Habaek, please be gentle.

131
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,348
Please be careful. Gosh!

132
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,355
Who is that man?

133
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,482
Professional skateboarders
can't participate.

134
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,777
That man you're looking at now

135
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,363
had never even seen a skateboard
until today.

136
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,646
<i>Don't you...</i>

137
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>feel like something in your heart...</i>

138
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,910
<i>is smacking...</i>

139
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,206
<i>your head?</i>

140
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,463
You came.

141
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,051
Yes, he is that guy.

142
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,988
Gosh, this is crazy.
Why did I have to run into that guy here?

143
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,407
You, my servant over there!

144
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,617
I'm here!

145
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,078
My gosh, what's his problem?
What is he doing?

146
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,456
Is he following me? Why?
Why is he following me?

147
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,001
-Are you sure she's a descendant?
-Yes.

148
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,337
What did I tell you?
I said it'd wake her up.

149
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,631
Hang on a second.

150
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,841
-Why on earth am I running away?
-Hey, servant!

151
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,092
Oh, right.

152
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,762
He said we're all equal to nature.
My goodness.

153
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,889
By the way, why is she running away?

154
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,266
She's looking for me, not running away.

155
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,851
She <i>is </i>running away.

156
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,687
Hey, servant!

157
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,523
You slow-witted woman! I'm right here!

158
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,526
Gosh, what a psycho!

159
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,892
Let's go.

160
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,193
Goodness, this guy
is blocking our way again.

161
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,569
Move!

162
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,031
How impudent.

163
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,158
<i>Gosh, this is so crazy.</i>

164
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,077
<i>-Why did I--</i>
-Servant!

165
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,937
Why...

166
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,565
Why did I run away
when I've done nothing wrong?

167
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,194
This is all Sang-yu's fault.

168
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,614
Why did he tell me to exercise?

169
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,826
I shouldn't have to worry about diabetes.
I'm a doctor.

170
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,923
It got in the water.
Find something we can use to get it out.

171
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,675
-Gosh, seriously!
-I'll come with you.

172
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,545
<i>Please!</i>

173
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,547
<i>Please save me!</i>

174
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,093
<i>Dad!</i>

175
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,595
<i>Dad!</i>

176
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,217
I told you that humans
are not trustworthy.

177
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,845
<i>You want a prize?</i>

178
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,181
Had you wanted to scam me,
you should've done it properly.

179
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,809
Which professional team
does he belong to? Seriously.

180
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,394
Why did you do that?

181
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,648
I told you not to go overboard
and to do it like a newbie.

182
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,441
You're so mean.

183
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,069
Had I had the kind of power that you have,

184
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,739
I would have gladly used it for you.

185
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,825
I feel the same way.

186
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,538
I wanted to win all the prizes
and make you happy.

187
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,790
Lord Habaek.

188
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,963
My Lord...

189
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,424
You didn't actually think
I'd say such a thing, did you?

190
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,259
Of course not.

191
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,358
It clearly didn't wake her up.

192
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,736
You should just give up.

193
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,447
It'd be faster to appeal to her sympathy.

194
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,538
<i>The total site is 20,000</i> pyeong.

195
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,875
According to our research,
there are five landowners in total.

196
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,211
About 15,000 <i>pyeong</i> of the land
can be purchased with no issues.

197
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,754
Do we have the landowners'
contact information?

198
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,130
Yes, we do.

199
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,132
Well, but...

200
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,804
Go ahead.

201
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,226
It looks like it won't be easy to purchase
the remaining 5,000 <i>pyeong.</i>

202
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,311
It's because...

203
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,314
that land belongs to Chairman Shin.

204
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,567
It's not easy to persuade him.

205
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,735
I'll take care of it.

206
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,112
Yes, sir.

207
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,827
Of all, Chairman Shin's land...

208
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,829
The selling price will jump up.

209
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,380
Yes, Mr. Choi. Go ahead.

210
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,882
Sure. We'll be fine with that.

211
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,802
No. Please prepare the second car.

212
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,095
Thank you.

213
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,808
Apparently, it'll take some time
for the windshield wiper to arrive.

214
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,976
Sure.

215
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,479
I can’t wait all day.

216
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,607
You've kept me waiting since this morning.

217
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,150
I'm not asking for a new loan.

218
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,485
I just want an extension.

219
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,612
Is it that hard to check it for me?

220
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,698
What's the point of having a big car?

221
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,659
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

222
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,411
I don't think...

223
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,705
they can afford the repair cost.

224
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,499
Why is it so expensive?
It's just a windshield wiper.

225
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,502
What? Rain sensors?

226
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,465
I get it.

227
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,932
Hello.

228
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,657
How was your trip to Gangwon Province?

229
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,411
By the way, about the windshield wiper...

230
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,205
The cost of genuine parts and the labor...

231
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,834
I have a friend who works at a body shop.

232
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,503
-He said if we don't use genuine--
-Do you think they'll understand?

233
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,008
I think I'll have to move out.

234
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,679
Tell them we'll go through insurance.

235
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,764
Pardon?

236
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,017
Don't be so down when you talk to them.

237
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,437
Have confidence and make it simple.
Practice.

238
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,524
Sure. Go through insurance.

239
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,652
All right.

240
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,450
Patient Ma Bong-yeol is going to be
hospitalized today,

241
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,077
and he needs a reference from you.

242
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,037
Also, Park Sang-cheol called again.

243
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,663
He said he'll call again.

244
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,542
Gosh.

245
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,795
<i>Gosh.</i>

246
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,565
How can you sleep for that long?

247
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,692
I was tired.

248
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,321
You might be fine
because you're a pure deity,

249
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,866
but I'm just an ordinary deity,
and I get tired like humans.

250
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,497
I'm starving too.

251
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,333
-Is that something I must hear?
-Sorry.

252
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,173
Let's go.

253
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,592
Pardon me? To where?

254
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,635
Home.

255
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,137
Home?

256
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,056
Where...

257
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,228
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH

258
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,646
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

259
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,523
If I'd have known that you had this
in your hand,

260
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,192
we wouldn't have gone to Gangwon Province
and gone through all that.

261
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,778
But at least I'm smart enough

262
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,197
to remember the money
Ms. Descendant gave me.

263
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,283
Otherwise, we'd be walking all day again.

264
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,786
But I wonder whether
Ms. Descendant will be so generous.

265
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,999
-What?
-Hey.

266
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,836
-Yes?
-I'd like to try driving.

267
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,880
-What?
-I said I'll do it.

268
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,299
-Driving.
-What is he saying?

269
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,010
-Get out of my car now.
-I'm sorry. Okay.

270
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,763
I'm sorry.

271
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:37,893
<i>Who came by?</i>

272
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,895
The agent of the landowner.

273
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,563
What did Mr. Bang come here for?

274
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,565
I thought they're taking
the rent off the deposit.

275
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,067
It was something like an ultimatum.

276
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,403
He wants to raise the deposit
by 50 million won.

277
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,529
What?

278
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:02,918
That's him.

279
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,544
Yes. We're almost there.

280
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,546
Yes, sir.

281
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,051
He'd like to see you in an hour.

282
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,388
Chairman Shin won't look at
the business proposal, as you said.

283
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,766
Sure, he won't.

284
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,893
U-TURN 250M AHEAD

285
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,037
-I'll help you.
-No, thank you.

286
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,375
-It's fine. I can handle myself. Go on.
-Okay.

287
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,334
Are we here?

288
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,461
It says it's across the street.

289
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,089
Oh, we have to cross too.

290
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,840
There she is.

291
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,761
I told you. She has been awakened.

292
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,721
Sir, I'll help you.

293
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,140
No, it's fine. Go on.

294
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,979
Isn't she the windshield doctor?

295
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,231
Her hospital must be near here.

296
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,117
Thank you.

297
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,422
I guess she saw something we didn't
since she's a psychiatrist.

298
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,924
Maybe.

299
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,260
She looks good in the doctor's gown.

300
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,555
I agree.

301
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,025
My goodness!

302
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,738
How did you get here?

303
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,531
I took what's called a taxi.

304
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,200
It was more spacious than your car.

305
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,578
So now I only have half of the money
you gave me.

306
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,581
Good to see you again.

307
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,541
Why did you just leave yesterday?

308
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,876
What?

309
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,462
If you've been awakened,
you should come and say hello.

310
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,090
Teach her etiquette first.

311
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,095
I won't need your help so much.

312
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,721
First, I need a house to stay,

313
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,474
and since I don't eat,
food for Namsuri to feel full,

314
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,559
and a change of clothes.

315
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,104
Give me what you call "money."

316
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,231
I heard it's better if you have more.

317
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,274
I'll let you know if I need anything else.

318
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,739
Also, there are gods I have to find.

319
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,409
The coronation must take place
immediately.

320
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,786
So try your best to find them
as fast as you can.

321
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,956
Do you have any questions?

322
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,459
Let's talk.

323
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,009
Sir, you shouldn't
let him do what he wants.

324
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,720
Does he go to a hospital?

325
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,179
Pardon?

326
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,056
No?

327
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,476
Hey, look.

328
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,479
Mental illness is the same
as physical illness.

329
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,314
Don't you go to a hospital
when you're sick?

330
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,276
Do you just endure the pain of
your injuries until it gets better?

331
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,986
Namsuri is very hungry.

332
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,987
And I need water.

333
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,323
Then go home
and take care of your problems.

334
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,159
-Where is your house?
-No.

335
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,910
Not my house. Your house.

336
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,331
Sorry, but we don't have a place to go.

337
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,833
Please help us.

338
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,544
Then you could go
to the community service center

339
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,671
in your neighborhood and ask for help.

340
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,300
I don't know how good
the welfare system is in this country,

341
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,095
but I think it is the country's duty

342
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,765
to take care of and be responsible
for people like you.

343
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,016
It's not a personal problem.

344
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,227
Let's eat up.

345
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,240
<i>That's why we're paying taxes.</i>

346
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,035
I can't afford to look after other people.

347
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,997
Then why did you just walk
with the old man?

348
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,042
When...

349
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,043
When did I do that?

350
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,713
I saw it. I saw it all.

351
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,633
-I was just walking.
-You were walking with him.

352
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,384
I was only walking.

353
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,473
You're not very honest.

354
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,976
That's got nothing to do with this.
The country--

355
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,979
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I know.

356
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,735
Anyway, if you ever show up here again,

357
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,403
I'll report you to the police.

358
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,824
If you leave like this, I'll let you go.

359
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,867
That means I'll abandon you.

360
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,663
I'm very glad to hear that.

361
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,293
See?

362
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,504
It did not wake her.

363
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,346
-What's up?
-Did you meet Mr. Bang?

364
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,266
No, not yet. Where's his office again?
I should go there.

365
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,601
<i>It's not far, but you should</i>
<i>get back here first.</i>

366
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,436
<i>Mr. Ma Bong-yeol's guardian is here.</i>

367
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,772
<i>He's checking into a hospital today,</i>
<i>and he needs your signature.</i>

368
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,774
Really? Okay, I'll be there shortly.

369
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,609
<i>You're in trouble. Do you know who he is?</i>

370
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,361
-What?
-<i>Sorry?</i>

371
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,905
-What did you just say?
-I didn't say anything.

372
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,615
<i>You'll suffer to death.</i>

373
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,035
Gosh, these people...

374
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,328
How dare you threaten me?

375
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,475
Now we won't even be able
to appeal to her sympathy.

376
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,562
I asked you to give me a heads-up
before you do anything.

377
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,275
We should take care
of urgent business first.

378
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,985
I hate that we have to do this,

379
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,362
but we should go there.

380
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,322
Where?

381
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,865
The place I buried gold.

382
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,077
-Gold?
-I buried some gold

383
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,412
when I came here 55 years ago.

384
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,998
I didn't do it
to prepare for a day like this.

385
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,458
I didn't know it'd be this useful.

386
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,502
With that gold, I'll be able to find
a better place for you to stay.

387
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,420
So...

388
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,757
you're saying that you made me
go through all this trouble

389
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,593
when we had that option?

390
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,095
I didn't want to go there
because it has bad vibes.

391
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,932
Fugitives from the divine world
gather there.

392
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,350
Where is it?

393
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,894
-The pear tree field.
-Pear tree field?

394
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,274
Pear tree field.

395
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,403
This used to be a field of pear trees.

396
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,538
Gosh, this is not what I expected.

397
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,374
You say that all the time.

398
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,879
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry.

399
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,172
Just deal with it.

400
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,426
Here. Is that enough?

401
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,180
You're one strange man.

402
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,224
Are you really going to eat all this food?

403
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,396
Hold on. You need to finish the job
before you start eating.

404
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,438
What?

405
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,731
Oh, right.

406
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,990
The blockage on the path
from east to west will be removed,

407
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,867
which means energy will rush in
from both directions.

408
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,245
Like a tiger that threatens
all other creatures,

409
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,914
you have a triumphant
and bright future ahead.

410
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,334
You can expect great news
around November this year.

411
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,086
Great news?

412
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,170
Eat up.

413
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,900
What does hunger feel like?

414
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,445
Well, I can't really describe it in words,

415
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,238
but it sort of makes you act servile.

416
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,990
How pathetic.

417
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,742
It's just a feeling.

418
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,995
You're right. By the way,
I think what you said is right.

419
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,539
You said losing your power doesn't mean
you're no longer a god.

420
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,209
Since you still don't feel hunger,

421
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,502
you must be right.

422
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,253
Did you just realize that now?

423
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,423
Let's go.

424
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,342
Pardon? May I finish eating this?

425
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,888
What should we do now?

426
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,599
It'd be best
if we could find those deities,

427
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,392
but we have no means to do so right now.

428
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,728
Even if we decide to wait
for your power to come back,

429
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,480
we can't keep staying there.

430
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,232
Plus, I'll continue to get hungry,

431
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,734
so we'll need to find a way
to sustain ourselves.

432
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,821
You're still Lord Habaek
even without your power,

433
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,322
but this is really inconvenient.

434
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,282
Why do you think you lost your power?

435
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,328
We should find Ms. Descendant again
and ask her for--

436
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:25,123
You're being such a nuisance.
I can't take this anymore.

437
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,666
Pardon?

438
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,043
What did I do?

439
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,295
Stop following me
and reveal yourself already.

440
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,139
Why are you following me?

441
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,808
Aren't you Lord Habaek?

442
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,725
Who are you?

443
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,477
It's me.

444
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,816
He does look familiar.

445
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,734
It's me, Jugeollin.

446
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,361
Don't you recognize me?

447
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,072
-I don't know you.
-Jugeollin?

448
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,949
There's no way you don't know me.

449
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,577
You better know me.

450
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,911
-You--
-You little...

451
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,634
What on earth was that about?

452
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,806
You must've really lost all of your power.

453
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,891
How...

454
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,809
How can you not know me?

455
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,603
-Who are you?
-I...

456
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,107
I've been desperately waiting
for a day like this. You...

457
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,110
You're doomed now.

458
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,032
Who is that scum?

459
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,162
Lord Habaek.

460
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,581
Are you all right?

461
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,793
Who is he?

462
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,337
He's the voracious deity, Jugeollin.

463
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,464
He fled from the Land of Water
because of you and Mura.

464
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,590
Who?

465
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,634
He kissed you.

466
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,512
You'll be okay, right?

467
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,603
Yes, Mr. Bang.

468
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,105
I'm one of your tenants
at Daebak Building.

469
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,982
Blessed Mental Health Clinic.

470
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,443
Yes, that's right. Where are you now?

471
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,612
I'd like to meet with you.

472
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,704
Look who's here.

473
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,624
Where do you even come from?

474
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,877
What brings you here?

475
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,630
Are you here to take more things
from my family or what?

476
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,553
-He's completely ignoring me.
-Hello, sir.

477
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,474
-Hey, my nephew is here.
-He's not really your nephew.

478
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:52,103
Just because he's our family on paper
doesn't make him our family.

479
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,939
Be respectful, will you?

480
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,983
Respectful, my foot.

481
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,986
Be quiet. Give me the car key.

482
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,282
Grandpa!

483
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,326
You know how well people treat you
because you own a few buildings.

484
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,330
Let me run my own talent agency.

485
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,874
Your car is over there, so just leave.

486
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,420
From the towing fee and
the storage cost to the penalty...

487
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,589
You eat up so much money.

488
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,508
Grandpa, listen to me.

489
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,927
A celebrity like me shouldn't
get a ticket for illegal parking

490
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,221
and have her car towed!

491
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,556
Help me start a business!

492
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,641
Let's go.

493
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,518
Don't stay out late!

494
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,022
Grandpa, please. Grandpa!

495
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,106
Don't leave, Grandpa.

496
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,026
Mr. Cha.

497
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,957
Why did you give my role in
the romantic drama to a no-name actress?

498
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,252
Sir!

499
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,046
Hello.

500
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,466
-Is the tenant leaving today?
-Yes.

501
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,135
Do a thorough check before they leave.

502
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,387
Make sure they don't leave
any garbage in the property.

503
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,681
You know how expensive garbage bags are.

504
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,391
Please don't worry, sir.

505
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,855
That rude jerk.

506
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,107
He didn't even bother to say goodbye.

507
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,568
<i>Eighth floor.</i>

508
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,281
I paid so much money
for her medical school.

509
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,119
If I had two grandchildren,
I would've gotten rid of her already.

510
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,802
You won't believe how much
I had to pay in taxes this month.

511
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,637
Those ruthless thieves.

512
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,890
They've done nothing for me,
but why are they taking so much money?

513
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,435
So,

514
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,522
did you say that you're going
to build a new resort?

515
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,650
Yes, sir. I think I'll need
a lot of your help.

516
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,115
I'm just an old man.
How will I be able to help you?

517
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,410
I vaguely heard about it from Mr. Min.

518
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,162
But it was so complicated
that I really couldn't understand.

519
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,956
So let's just get to the point.

520
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,000
How much will I be able to earn
from this deal?

521
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,545
I'm planning to pay five times
the official price.

522
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,594
Those countrymen will get
to earn some money.

523
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,890
How much will you give me then?

524
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,602
<i>That's so immoral.</i>

525
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,855
"Immoral"?

526
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,483
You can't even afford to pay rent,
so I'm taking the money from your deposit.

527
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,154
Don't you think you're the one
who's being more immoral?

528
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:52,283
I'm really sorry about that,
and I'm also very grateful.

529
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:56,412
So please help me by convincing him
not to raise the deposit.

530
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,997
Once my clinic settles down--

531
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,207
"That's exactly what I don't understand!

532
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,419
Why are you trying to settle down
in my building?"

533
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,922
That's exactly what the chairman will say,

534
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,549
in my opinion.

535
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,219
"She should settle down
in some other building!

536
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,681
Why is she trying to settle down
in my building?"

537
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,227
That's what he'll say as he scolds me.

538
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,858
Okay, then. I'll talk to him myself.

539
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,443
No, you can't do that!

540
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,199
The chairman is not available right now.

541
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,413
I'll pay six times
the original price for your land.

542
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,374
You're paying five times
the original price to those

543
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,335
who you're not even acquainted with.

544
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,420
Don't you think you're being cheap
towards your family?

545
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,297
I won't be too greedy.

546
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,091
Just pay me...
ten times the original price.

547
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,010
I'll pay you seven times
the original price.

548
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,477
I'm sure you have your reputation
to think about at work,

549
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,479
so I, your uncle, will help you save face.

550
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,984
By the way, are you trying to build
an amusement park or something?

551
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,737
I heard restaurants earn
a lot of money in amusement parks.

552
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,405
It'll be open bidding.

553
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,783
If you're interested,
you should get ready to participate.

554
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,118
Why are you making things so complicated?

555
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,455
You can just add another article
in my contract.

556
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,499
I'm willing to give you my precious land.

557
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,543
Just cut me some slack
and make it easy for me.

558
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,797
I can't do that, sir.

559
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,300
Who is it?

560
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,598
Who are you?

561
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:41,850
The third floor...

562
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,603
What?

563
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,648
I'm a tenant on the third floor
of Daebak Building.

564
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,358
I'm a doctor working
at Blessed Mental Health.

565
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,110
Oh, yes. That mental hospital.

566
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,445
It's not exactly a mental hospital.

567
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,156
You suddenly doubled the deposit,
so I came here to talk about that.

568
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,660
That's great. I've been meaning to
meet you anyway. I'm glad you came.

569
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,371
Why are you always so late
in paying your monthly rent?

570
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,039
You have no common sense.

571
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,499
You should know well.

572
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,003
Why are you causing a huge loss
on someone else's property?

573
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:13,716
I barely manage to live day to day
with your monthly rent.

574
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,051
Are you trying to starve me to death?

575
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,513
You have a guest with you,
so I'll just come back next time.

576
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,472
There's no need.

577
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,309
You can stay if you have money.
If not, please move out.

578
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,353
I'm not so smart,
so I hate complicated things.

579
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,450
Young people these days
only seem to blame others.

580
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,543
My gosh, why did he have
to be there again?

581
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,546
<i>You now belong to the gods.</i>

582
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,174
<i>Accept your fate,</i>
<i>or you'll go through everything.</i>

583
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,342
This can't be...

584
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:01,263
the "everything" that
I'll be going through, can it?

585
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,895
Why am I thinking of such weird things?

586
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,106
<i>Please give me water. I'm really thirsty.</i>

587
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,782
<i>Can't you hear me? Please give me water.</i>

588
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,617
<i>Are you trying to make me go dry?</i>

589
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,418
My gosh.

590
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,629
<i>Why did she have to be in my way?</i>
<i>How stupid.</i>

591
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,381
I'm sorry.

592
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,258
<i>Doors closing. Basement one.</i>

593
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,232
<i>First floor. Doors opening.</i>

594
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,693
You should go back to the bank again
and ask them for a loan.

595
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,321
Why are you always so nosy?
You should mind your own business.

596
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,365
You don't seem
to mind your own business either.

597
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,659
-What did you say?
-I saw you

598
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:07,204
putting on a very awkward act
at the crosswalk earlier.

599
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,169
-I was just walking.
-You were walking with him.

600
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,505
-I was just walking.
-You're not very honest.

601
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,299
<i>What is their problem?</i>

602
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,094
-I wasn't criticizing you.
-I didn't say you were.

603
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,640
-About that windshield wiper--
-I'll handle it

604
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,933
with the insurance company.

605
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,230
I was just about to tell you
that you don't need to pay for it.

606
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,316
Should I just mind my own business?

607
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,528
Well...

608
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,822
Yes, that's right.

609
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,033
I see.

610
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,621
Then I'd like you to pay the price.

611
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,137
Are you the guardian of Ma Bong-yeol?

612
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,140
What? He ran away?

613
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,434
<i>You're not very honest.</i>

614
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,560
<i>You're not very honest.</i>

615
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,604
Why do you care?

616
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,693
What?

617
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,988
-What?
-<i>He ran away</i>

618
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,115
<i>because he suddenly had a change of heart.</i>

619
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,412
Why did you let him get away?

620
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,164
What?

621
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,540
Why would I look for him?

622
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,294
I'm not in good condition either.

623
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,422
I keep hearing weird things.
I should get some rest.

624
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,802
It has nothing to do
with our hospital anymore.

625
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,845
They'll take care of it now.

626
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,806
Forget that and call the police.

627
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,058
Ask them if there's any progress
in catching the thief.

628
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,368
Are you looking at
what that kid's eating right now?

629
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,371
-No.
-Then what are you looking at?

630
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,414
I'm not looking at anything.

631
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,582
Do you want some?

632
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,209
Take that away.

633
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,547
Please let me know if you feel dizzy,

634
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,048
have back pains, or feel weak.

635
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,800
That's how it feels when you're hungry.

636
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,886
Eating this will help you feel better.

637
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,099
I guess if you lose your power,
spells of the lower deities work on you.

638
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,935
Why aren't we using a taxi?

639
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,438
We need to save up.
We both need to eat to survive now.

640
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,653
I had no idea Jugeollin would be here.

641
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,071
When exactly was it

642
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,240
when he challenged you to fight
and left a scar on--

643
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,908
He didn't leave that scar.

644
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,827
He accidentally dropped
his knife as he was so nervous.

645
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,288
As his knife dropped, it hit a twig
which bounced back and--

646
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,289
It doesn't matter.

647
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,792
I heard he ran away
after Mura threatened to kill him.

648
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,294
But I didn't know he'd be here.

649
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,297
I didn't know the human world
would be so full of trash.

650
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,635
Why do you think Jugeollin
asked you to fight him?

651
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,804
He must've been out of his mind.

652
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:12,973
This is not good.

653
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,851
You're even going to feel hunger now.

654
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,229
Why are things getting so complicated?

655
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,114
INCOMING CALL: SEUL-KI

656
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,617
Hey, I'm almost there.

657
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,202
I'm getting off now. Okay.

658
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,204
Mura?

659
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,272
-Lord Habaek!
<i>-Doors closing.</i>

660
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,107
Lord Habaek!

661
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,069
-Lord Habaek!
-Namsuri.

662
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,696
Lord Habaek!

663
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,702
Oh, no. What am I going to do?

664
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,236
<i>He apparently found a way</i>
<i>to contact aliens.</i>

665
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,238
He uploaded a selfie on
his social media account.

666
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,199
Hey, you're not supposed to look into
a patient's private life.

667
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,535
I didn't have a choice
because he threatened that

668
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,453
he'd go to another hospital
if I didn't add him.

669
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,414
I think he's at a subway station
right now.

670
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,583
It looks like he's in Gangseo-gu
by looking at the background.

671
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,419
Gosh, I feel like I know this place.

672
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,046
It says the next stop is Seonyudo Park.

673
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,673
That means he's near the Han River.

674
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,091
What a great detective you are.

675
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,509
<i>But what's this?</i>

676
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,012
<i>He wrote that he has finally met a god.</i>

677
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,180
I'm so sick of this nonsense about gods.

678
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,228
I'm the one who wants to meet a god.

679
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,359
My mother told me that humans
need to eat rice to gain energy.

680
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,529
But I gained energy
by eating chicken and pizza.

681
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,616
Of course, that's only after
my mother passed away.

682
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,249
Here.

683
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,501
Please eat this.

684
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,879
Don't refuse and eat up.

685
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,715
The eldest should always
get the drumstick.

686
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,384
-Here.
-What are you doing?

687
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,720
Gosh, I'm sorry.

688
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,076
People will believe me now<i> </i>that I have
a photo to show them as evidence.

689
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,289
Oh, right. How's TF 1004 doing?

690
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,834
I haven't been able to meet Obama yet.

691
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,586
I'm doing my best.

692
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,047
But I'm sorry to have disappointed you.

693
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,924
It wasn't like I had to save
the world or anything.

694
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,218
All I had to do was call Obama.

695
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,804
But I even failed to do
such a simple task.

696
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,931
If Obama finds out about this...

697
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,766
Who in the world is Obama?

698
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,434
Pardon?

699
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,438
He's not here.

700
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,856
I even went to the station office.

701
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,275
The workers told me
that nothing peculiar happened.

702
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,529
Are you happy now? You can
close the hospital a little early today.

703
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,781
I'm so tired. I need to go home
and take a rest.

704
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,741
<i>He just uploaded something new</i>
<i>on his Instagram.</i>

705
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,409
-Hey!
-<i>I think he's at Hangang Park.</i>

706
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,412
<i>-I'll send it to you right away.</i>
-Don't send me anything.

707
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,750
My gosh, this punk!

708
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,252
NURSE YU: PHOTO

709
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,671
My gosh, I told him not
to send me anything.

710
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,465
-Nurse Yu.
-<i>Did you know</i>

711
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,842
<i>that Mr. Ma tried to commit suicide</i>

712
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,593
<i>when he was getting treated</i>
<i>at another hospital?</i>

713
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,553
What?

714
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,472
<i>That's why his family hesitated</i>
<i>in hospitalizing him.</i>

715
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:23,723
But...

716
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,810
Why are they telling us that now?

717
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,729
It must've been hard for the family
to talk about it. What should we do?

718
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,982
Call the police and ask them to find him.

719
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,401
<i>He hates the police and firemen.</i>

720
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,194
<i>So you should...</i>

721
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,320
Nurse Yu!

722
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,238
<i>Yes?</i>

723
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,034
Call the police
and wash your hands of this matter.

724
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,078
Do you understand?

725
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,978
Why is everyone giving me a hard time?

726
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,399
I'm not going to live like them.

727
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,037
NURSE YU

728
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,749
<i>What are you doing, and where are you?</i>

729
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,094
NURSE YU

730
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,931
<i>I called the management office</i>
<i>of Hangang Park.</i>

731
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,515
<i>It's not too far from there.</i>

732
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,060
My gosh, is he doing this for fun?

733
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,980
-What? Obama?
-Yes.

734
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,943
Who is Obama? Why do you keep
talking about him?

735
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:02,572
Well, Obama was the 44th president
of the United States.

736
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,283
He first ran for the presidency
in 2008 as a Democrat.

737
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,118
I don't get what you're saying.

738
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,495
Pardon?

739
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,664
I don't get what you're saying.

740
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,708
But I know for sure
that Obama can't save the world.

741
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:14,668
What?

742
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,545
My gosh, why does it have
to be the Han River of all places?

743
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,549
My goodness.
I don't know why I have to do this.

744
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,767
Why can't he save the world?

745
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,060
My gosh, it's true.

746
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,436
Isn't it obvious?

747
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,021
It really is that guy.

748
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,440
-Then...
-Why is he there?

749
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,359
Then who can save the world?

750
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,945
How am I supposed to know that?

751
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,198
But I wouldn't have told you
even if I did know

752
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,451
because I'm not interested in humans.

753
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,376
My gosh!

754
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,379
Then why did TF 1004 call me and--

755
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,964
Because he doesn't exist.

756
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,717
What do you mean?

757
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,884
There is not a single person

758
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,137
with that kind of name

759
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,139
in any of the three lands of gods.

760
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,142
He doesn't exist.

761
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,936
Don't lie to me!

762
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,397
He shouldn't get too angry.

763
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,649
Stop lying to me, you swindler!

764
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,159
Listen to me carefully,
you worthless human.

765
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,995
I am the next king of the Land of Water

766
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,122
and the next emperor of deities.

767
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,833
I am Habaek, the God of Water.

768
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:41,838
But if you really are a god,
you should know who can save the world.

769
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,298
If it's not Obama, then who is it?

770
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,635
Listen to me carefully,
you worthless human.

771
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,597
It takes just one person
to ruin the world,

772
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,600
but it takes more than one person
to save the world.

773
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,895
So...

774
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,523
it's not something Obama can do
by himself.

775
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,941
But...

776
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:06,071
You should just focus
on doing your best in life.

777
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,739
Don't waste time
wandering around like this.

778
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,991
My gosh, that fool.

779
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,869
What more can I do?

780
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,832
What more can I do right now?

781
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,418
Regardless of how much I try,
I still can't reach the sky.

782
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,587
What more can I do?

783
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,130
I...

784
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,009
I can't touch the sky.

785
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,223
Mr. Ma Bong-yeol.

786
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,601
What...

787
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,894
What are you doing here?

788
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,104
Mr. Ma,

789
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,522
you can talk to me.

790
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:44,109
Talk to you about what?
You don't even listen to what I say!

791
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,068
About your story.

792
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,154
The story that you've always
wanted to tell me.

793
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,865
I know that you wanted to show your father

794
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,867
that you could reach the sky.

795
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,954
That's why you tried hard to meet Obama.
Let's talk about that story.

796
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,456
I already told you.

797
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,999
I already told you everything,

798
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,001
but you ignored me!

799
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,254
She tends to do that.

800
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,508
-Mr. Ma, I--
-Don't come near me.

801
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,843
I don't want to talk to you.

802
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,136
But Mr. Ma...

803
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,140
Humans are so loud.

804
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:19,978
I should throw this away...

805
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,606
-no matter what.
-No. I don't need your help.

806
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,526
I'm going to meet TF 1004.

807
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,822
He's the only person
who actually understands me.

808
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,826
Wait. Mr. Ma!

809
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,579
Stop right there!

810
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,502
Mr. Ma...

811
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,090
Should I keep this and give it to Namsuri?

812
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,342
Please...

813
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,219
Please stop him right now.

814
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,847
How dare a servant tell me what to do?

815
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,265
You do it.

816
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,560
Mr. Ma.

817
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,063
Please come here. I'm sorry.

818
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,107
You were always like that
while treating me.

819
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,568
"Yes, I see. So?

820
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,404
I understand."

821
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,781
What do you even understand?

822
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,283
Even now,

823
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,912
you act like you care for me,
but you have no intention of helping me.

824
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,830
I'm sure you never even thought about...

825
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,000
helping me while you sat behind
that desk of yours.

826
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,543
No.

827
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,921
I...

828
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:52,862
I...

829
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,282
I...

830
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,340
14 YEARS AGO

831
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,763
Dad.

832
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,643
Please.

833
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,026
<i>The person you are calling</i>
<i>cannot answer your call.</i>

834
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,153
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

835
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,799
I'm going to make you regret this
for the rest of your life.

836
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,897
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

837
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,806
<i>Please. Please save me.</i>

838
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,894
<i>Help me!</i>

839
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:50,980
<i>Please.</i>

840
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,316
<i>Please help me!</i>

841
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,693
<i>Dad!</i>

842
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,737
<i>Dad!</i>

843
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:06,996
<i>I regretted it.</i>

844
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,875
<i>It was cold, dark,</i>

845
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,169
<i>lonely, and scary.</i>

846
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,171
<i>But no one was there to help me.</i>

847
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,001
What are you doing?
I said I'm going to die right now!

848
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,462
Do you think I'm lying?

849
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,257
Are you mocking me?
Do you think I won't be able to do it?

850
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,804
Fine, I hope you all live a great life.

851
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,931
I hate this filthy world!

852
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,146
No, no! Mr. Ma, stop!

853
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,360
-Help!
-No.

854
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,571
No!

855
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,367
-Help!
-No.

856
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:29,579
Mr. Ma!

857
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,999
Dr. Yun, help!

858
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,041
<i>Please.</i>

859
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,544
<i>Please save me!</i>

860
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:37,879
<i>Dad!</i>

861
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:39,964
No, please...

862
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:40,882
No!

863
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,930
No. No!

864
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:48,973
Help!

865
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:54,937
No!

866
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,926
You're one reckless woman.

867
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,429
Hold this.

868
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,932
You guys are so loud.

869
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,267
I want all of you to leave my house.

870
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,146
I didn't want to go in
because it's so dirty.

871
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,236
No!

872
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,695
No!

873
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,491
My gosh, no! Please come out.

874
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,285
Get out of the water!

875
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,082
Please get out of the water. Please.

876
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,336
Gosh, I'm sorry.

877
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,755
I'm sorry.

878
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,676
I apologize for everything.

879
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,475
<i>I told you to be quiet.</i>

880
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,452
My gosh. Mr. Ma!

881
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,883
Mr. Ma. Please...

882
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,009
Please.

883
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:56,684
Stop it!

884
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,106
My lips belong to TF 1004.

885
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,112
I'm sorry.

886
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,783
And thank you.

887
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,331
I'm glad you're thankful.

888
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,417
Take that fool away from here.

889
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,942
Hey!

890
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,277
I told you to hold this!

891
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:50,863
It's not...

892
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,824
because I wanted to eat this.

893
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,243
I was just saving it for Namsuri.

894
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,895
Thank you.

895
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,040
<i>Fate.</i>

896
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,376
<i>It must be fate.</i>

897
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,201
<i>Are you really a god?</i>

898
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,786
<i>Habaek is here.</i>

899
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,954
<i>I've been thinking about you.</i>

900
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:22,913
Shut up.

901
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,583
<i>Nothing could get you off my mind.</i>

902
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:26,917
<i>I must be going crazy.</i>

903
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,045
<i>Look who's here. A beggar.</i>

904
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,547
<i>Why are you following my woman</i>
<i>around and bothering her?</i>

905
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,257
<i>Were you playing</i>
<i>the knight in shining armor?</i>

906
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,717
<i>I keep running into this girl, Yun So-a.</i>

907
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,595
Shall we switch over to a mystery,
thriller, and suspense movie?

908
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,182
You and I are accomplices
with regard to the sacred stone.

909
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,809
<i>Were you toying with me?</i>
<i>You foolish human.</i>

910
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,062
<i>Don't you dare test me.</i>

911
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,733
EPILOGUE

912
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,319
-High Priest.
-Gosh, you brat.

913
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,073
Wait, High Priest.

914
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,657
High Priest.

915
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,202
What is fate? Please tell me.

916
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,996
-I won't tell you.
-High Priest, please.

917
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,957
High Priest, what is fate? Please tell me.

918
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,795
Disclosing the profound secret.
