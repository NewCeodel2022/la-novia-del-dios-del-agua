1
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,719
I'm going to leave.

2
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,973
I have to leave.

3
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,936
I said I'm going to leave.

4
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,679
I...

5
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,612
MURA

6
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,656
<i>Judong woke up.</i>

7
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,248
Did he wake up?

8
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,041
You should go.

9
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,012
I can see the end now.

10
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,559
Show me the sacred stone when you find it.

11
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,283
It's probably another one of those things
that only you guys can see.

12
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,014
<i>You're right.</i>

13
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,934
<i>I'm going to leave soon,</i>
<i>and you belong to this world.</i>

14
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,604
<i>So we should not waste time</i>
<i>being each other's happiness.</i>

15
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,733
<i>We should not mistake fake wings...</i>

16
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,819
<i>for wings that can fly.</i>

17
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,493
Habaek!

18
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,166
Hey.

19
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,839
My gosh!

20
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,769
-Hospital?
-That's right.

21
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,021
When I woke up, I was at the hospital.

22
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,273
A passerby saw me

23
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,483
and took me to the hospital.

24
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,778
I had no idea who I was or what happened.

25
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,279
I couldn't remember a thing.

26
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,531
That man left his contact information,

27
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,034
so I called him thinking
he might know something

28
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,660
but couldn't reach him.

29
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,371
Then how did you end up at the temple?

30
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,874
I wandered around like a homeless guy
after leaving the hospital.

31
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,251
Then I worked in a salt field
in the south for a while.

32
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,922
I also worked at a donkey farm,
a perilla leaf farm, and a larva farm.

33
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,466
I sailed for a bit too.
Then I sold supplements.

34
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,551
"Kids, go away. This is very rare.

35
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,305
If you take this, your head,
shoulders, knees, and back..."

36
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,683
I followed the seller around for a while,
then I somehow ended up at the temple.

37
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,019
I know you passed out
because of Biryeom's thunderbolt,

38
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,605
but I don't understand
how it wiped out all your memories.

39
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,981
It was Mr. Shin's doing.

40
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,025
He confessed to Biryeom.

41
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,201
Where's the sacred stone?

42
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,207
Finally...

43
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,837
Oh, no. Have you guys seen my tablet?

44
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,465
Hey, you brought it here?

45
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,509
-Why on earth did you bring it?
-I was told to bring it here.

46
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,303
-You didn't bring yours either?
-No.

47
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,680
Why would we? It's of no use here.

48
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,600
Habaek is one thing,
but you're such a bonehead too.

49
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,894
Jeez, I knew I was forgetting something.

50
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,854
Where did I lose it?

51
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,524
It's not your home.
Why must you go back there every day?

52
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,276
And why are you following him?

53
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,820
Just stay with us. It's not like
you'll be here for much longer.

54
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,615
I heard Habaek's place has no walls.

55
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,662
The walls at you and your husband's place
make me claustrophobic.

56
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,087
What?

57
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,467
Have you lost your mind? My husband?

58
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,428
Am I wrong? I guess I could be
remembering it wrong.

59
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,096
Remember the fight you two had?

60
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,350
Biryeom said you two are engaged
but haven't spent the night together yet.

61
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,727
I remember him saying
he wants to get it done--

62
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,020
Hey!

63
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,692
Do you want to get your tongue crushed?

64
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,250
By the way,
Biryeom has been acting a little strange.

65
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,460
He's been overly sensitive
and hostile toward Mr. Shin.

66
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,380
It also looks like he's purposely
trying to provoke him.

67
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,840
I get that he can't be fond of him,

68
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,261
but there's no need for him to be
so obvious about despising him.

69
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,888
I mean, this isn't the divine realm.

70
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,056
It doesn't even matter here.

71
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,142
You said he's the one
who did that to Judong.

72
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,353
No. That's not entirely true.

73
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,771
He did use his powers on me,

74
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,273
but it wasn't intentional.

75
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,484
He probably did it without realizing it
because he was thrown off.

76
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,987
Biryeom thinks that it was intentional.

77
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,447
I'm worried that he might end up
causing trouble.

78
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,286
By the way, is that man
a human being or a god?

79
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,622
-We can't harm him if he's human.
-That's why I'm worried.

80
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,850
-Is this where you live?
-Yes. This way, please.

81
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,812
Ms. Descendant must be home already.

82
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,830
I like this place.
Where is the owner of this house?

83
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,082
Should I bring her?

84
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,377
Leave her alone. I think she's asleep.

85
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,587
She'll be happy to hear
you've found your sacred stone.

86
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,802
Please excuse me.

87
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,936
Divine servants?

88
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,606
When Biryeom talked the Queen Mother
into establishing that custom,

89
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,566
many gods were against it.

90
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,694
Mura was one of them.

91
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,779
They thought it was unfair

92
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,449
to make humans take responsibility
for what gods did.

93
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,620
-Are you okay?
-With what?

94
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,873
I'm talking about the divine servants.

95
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,668
I know you tried your best
to forget about it.

96
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,586
<i>You've heard about</i>
<i>the divine servants, right?</i>

97
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,466
Humans who made a pledge to serve us
generation after generation.

98
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,636
If you run into problems,
find descendants of that family.

99
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,764
I'm not sure
if the High Priest should continue

100
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,727
to play along with you,
pretending not to remember--

101
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,979
I have completely erased it from my mind.

102
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,530
The moon has waxed and waned 1,200 times.

103
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,116
Whether you overcome it or just endure it,

104
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,662
it simply doesn't matter anymore
after that much time has passed.

105
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,754
The High Priest...

106
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,797
should know that much.

107
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,593
Why do you seem so down
when you've found all the sacred stones?

108
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,844
And what's with Mura?

109
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,306
She's dying to send you back.

110
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,808
She has asked me so many times already.

111
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,628
Heading out already?

112
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,713
Yes, I have to do something.

113
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,647
Bye.

114
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,455
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH

115
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,458
Why is the door open? My gosh!

116
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,506
Why are you so early today?

117
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,678
Hey, look.

118
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,764
You're just all talk.

119
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,851
I thought you usually get here
when the morning star is still up.

120
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,437
-Is something wrong?
-Yes, obviously.

121
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,480
We promised each other
that we'd work hard.

122
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,648
How could you get here now?

123
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,650
We open at 10 a.m.

124
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,527
Be quiet.
Starting today, we'll open at 8 a.m.

125
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,695
and close at 8 p.m.

126
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,947
We'll be open on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday evenings.

127
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,157
Announce it on our blog.

128
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,326
Okay.

129
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,996
-What's that?
-It's from Mr. Ma.

130
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,581
He said I've been looking tired lately.

131
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,958
I don't believe that.
I'm sure it's for me.

132
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,545
Shouldn't you know him better by now?

133
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,173
Do you want to read the reviews online?

134
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,758
We have so many new bad reviews.

135
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,717
Forget it.

136
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,516
Try one. You can just suck it.

137
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,684
I don't want it.

138
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,561
Come on. Try it.

139
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
Enjoy.

140
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,248
<i>Sang-yu worries about you</i>
<i>more than you worry about yourself.</i>

141
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,088
DR. YUN SO-A

142
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,055
<i>I'm going to leave. I have to leave.</i>

143
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,030
I said I'm going to leave.

144
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,713
MR. SHIN HU-YE

145
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,553
Hello?

146
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,054
<i>Can we meet this afternoon?</i>

147
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,348
Would you like to order?

148
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,725
2 AMERICANOS, REGULAR, WEAK

149
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,646
"Two Americanos, regular, weak."
Is that correct?

150
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,665
That prick said

151
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,584
we can't do anything to him...

152
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,753
because we're supposed to be saviors.

153
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,857
Why? What was that about?

154
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,027
I have to ask him.

155
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,419
I can't ask him.

156
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,828
Yes?

157
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,416
Ms. Yun is here, sir.

158
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,635
Have a seat here.

159
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,568
-Is it awkward for you to be here?
-Yes.

160
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,070
You'll get used to it
because you'll be coming here often.

161
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,947
-Pardon?
-The contract has been canceled.

162
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,117
Some objected, but I told them
you'll pay the early termination fee.

163
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,912
Thank you.

164
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,416
But regarding the early termination fee,
I can't--

165
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,793
Half of it can be paid
with your skill set.

166
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,753
With my skill set?

167
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,173
Hotel management
falls under the service sector.

168
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,049
It requires a lot of emotional labor,

169
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,885
especially the operators.

170
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,054
They always have to put customers
above themselves.

171
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,934
Please help my employees better cope
with their work-related stress.

172
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,812
I'm thinking one session per week
would be good.

173
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,441
Sure. Then the other half--

174
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,610
Thirty percent of it can be paid
through the farm.

175
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,655
You said I could ask you
if I ever needed help at the farm.

176
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,867
I wasn't going to pay you at all
for your labor,

177
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,745
but I'll deduct the amount
from the early termination fee.

178
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,165
As for the 20 percent that's left,

179
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,585
-you can pay it off by treating me.
-Sorry?

180
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,462
I still suffer from insomnia.

181
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,714
Book me in for the day after tomorrow,
in the afternoon.

182
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,009
I'll pay for your work at the farm
and my sessions out of my own pocket.

183
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,512
The money will be sent directly to Beriwon
under your name.

184
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,018
Where is he?

185
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,608
-I'm here.
-My gosh!

186
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,361
Where did he come from?

187
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,863
Come here.

188
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,824
-What's the matter?
-I have a question for you.

189
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,451
Go ahead.

190
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,167
What happened to your eyes?

191
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,921
Sit down.

192
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,302
What is it?

193
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,681
Did you attend the service last Sunday?

194
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,558
Of course. Do you want
to start attending my church?

195
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,977
Just find a church near you.

196
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,729
No, it's not that.

197
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,856
Were they there too?

198
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,484
-Do you need dating advice?
-No!

199
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,403
This isn't about dating.

200
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,196
I'm just curious about something.

201
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,787
Well, why would a guy
suddenly hug a girl from behind?

202
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,539
-I'd call it sexual harassment.
-No! It's...

203
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,457
-It's not like that.
-Did someone hug you?

204
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,001
You should've turned and punched him.

205
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,379
No, hear me out.
He's not that kind of guy!

206
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,882
What I'm saying is...

207
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,305
I just want to know
why Mr. Shin hugged me from behind.

208
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,725
My goodness.

209
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,352
You seemed a bit unstable yesterday.

210
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,687
You should get more sleep.

211
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,566
Hey, you don't believe me?

212
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,574
Oh, no. What do I do? My gosh.

213
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,079
Hold on.

214
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,750
-Isn't that So-a?
-Yes, it is.

215
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,835
Do you know her?

216
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,546
Why are they walking together?

217
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,758
Right, I guess you haven't heard
the news yet.

218
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,218
The Block World contract...

219
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,803
has been canceled.

220
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,513
What?

221
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,725
I can't believe this.

222
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,643
They're moving it to Chungcheong Province?

223
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,479
-Because of So-a?
-<i>Hello?</i>

224
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,482
Grandpa, do you own any land
in Chungcheong Province?

225
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,409
It's a good thing.

226
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,246
Actually, I've never been
this lucky in my whole life.

227
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,792
I'll be busy
for the first time in a while.

228
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,338
Why doesn't she want to sell that land?

229
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,589
How would I know?

230
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,676
What did you say about that land?

231
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,471
You said no one ever wanted to buy it.

232
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,764
That's right, sir.

233
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,225
I heard it had been for sale

234
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,644
for a long time at a very low price.

235
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,562
And they offered her a lot

236
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,023
because a new road will be built there.

237
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,234
I don't understand what her problem is.

238
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,736
Please excuse me, sir.
I have to take this call.

239
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,658
Do you own any land
in Chungcheong Province or not?

240
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,827
They'll find another site.

241
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,620
I have no land
in Chungcheong Province.

242
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,538
What?

243
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,291
You always said you own land
all over the country.

244
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,210
Why don't you own any
in Chungcheong Province?

245
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,840
Why haven't you bought any land there
all these years?

246
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,929
Sir. According to Mr. Lee at Beriwon,

247
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:55,559
she had agreed to sell the land
and even signed the contract.

248
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,436
But then she suddenly changed her mind.

249
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,187
What? Why?

250
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,356
Because of leopard poop.

251
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,525
What?

252
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,863
What? "Poop"?

253
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,323
-Yes, leopard poop.
-What's he saying?

254
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,494
Sang-yu, I'm picking up a part-time job
starting today.

255
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,620
Dr. Yun.

256
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,377
What brings you here?

257
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,049
Had I known I could find you here,
I would've caused a scene long ago.

258
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,594
-What?
-I had forgotten

259
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,720
why I hated you.

260
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,057
You were so stuck-up,
even though you had nothing.

261
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,727
You pretended to be so innocent and naive

262
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,479
and enjoyed all the attention you got.

263
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,355
"I'm different. I'm special."

264
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,733
You were always so condescending

265
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,734
and pretentious!

266
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,695
Hey, who are you talking about?

267
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,530
I had forgotten all about it,

268
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,116
but that guy reminded me.

269
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,787
Isn't he one of the beggars
that used to freeload off your family?

270
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,040
Hey, watch your mouth.

271
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,042
You're not selling your land
because of leopard poop?

272
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,335
What?

273
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,297
This is exactly why I can't stand you.

274
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,508
Who cares about leopard poop?

275
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,842
You can't even pay your rent.

276
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,428
Can you really afford
to care about leopard poop?

277
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,222
What is that annoying voice?

278
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,225
Wait.

279
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,227
-Aren't you Shin Ja-ya?
-Jo Yeom-mi?

280
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,395
It's been a long time,
but I'm not happy to see you.

281
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,855
What are you doing here?

282
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,734
Everyone's here.

283
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,071
The beggar, the stuck-up,
and the fortune-teller.

284
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,617
Is this a countryside market or something?

285
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,412
Hey, what's that called? Oh, right.

286
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,833
If we had a street singer here,
it'd be just perfect.

287
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,087
Ja-ya, are you bipolar?
Why are you so worked up?

288
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,925
Ja-ya, you...

289
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:53,927
What?

290
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,845
A long-haired woman
is sitting on your back.

291
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,932
There's a child on your leg too.

292
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,102
He has no nose.

293
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,190
And an old lady is standing over there.

294
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,156
My gosh!

295
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,621
Let's go.

296
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,708
-Get us something to drink.
-Okay.

297
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,502
What was that about?

298
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,296
Grandpa, kick her out.

299
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,383
You brat,
who are you to tell me what to do?

300
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,635
Your building is haunted.

301
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,887
What? Cut it out!

302
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,348
Don't say things
that'll bring the price down.

303
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,516
Get back here right now!

304
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,059
Oh, dear.

305
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,860
It's so strange.

306
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,695
How did Ja-ya find out?

307
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,323
And how does she know
about my rent situation?

308
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,616
Is she stalking me?

309
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,909
Why is she being so nosy?

310
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,911
By the way, she's becoming prettier
by the day.

311
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,873
Hey, do I seem pretentious?

312
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,001
Do I enjoy getting attention
while pretending to be all naive?

313
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,378
Do I act like I'm special
or better than others?

314
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,339
What did I do?

315
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,049
How would I know
what you were like in high school?

316
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,091
In high school?

317
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,719
Think about it. She's talking about
your high school days.

318
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,679
It's not about something you did.

319
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,848
I bet she's upset about
something you didn't do.

320
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,392
You know, there are those kids
who always get good grades,

321
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,686
even though they don't seem
to study at all.

322
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,648
They get on your nerves
because they never study. It's like that.

323
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,733
Hey, I studied so hard back in school.

324
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,611
That's not what I'm talking about.

325
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,199
What brings you here out of the blue?

326
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,660
Why did you show up in my dream
out of the blue?

327
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,578
-What?
-I've seen all kinds of people

328
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,539
in my dreams since I started my career,
but never you.

329
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,416
This morning, you showed up in my dream

330
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,335
and laughed like a crazy person.

331
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,672
So I was wondering
if you have any good news to share.

332
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,718
But I have to say,
you seem a little down today.

333
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,095
Is something wrong?

334
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,013
No.

335
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,768
I'm just trying to solve
a very difficult math problem.

336
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,396
-You used to be good at math.
-Yes, you're right.

337
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,358
But this problem scares me a little.

338
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,653
The answer is already there,

339
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,281
but the problem-solving process
doesn't match the answer.

340
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,410
Then the process must be wrong.

341
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,828
Right, it is wrong.

342
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,958
So, I have to find another value of X now.

343
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,838
A value that will help me arrive
at the answer without hurting anyone.

344
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,339
I'm not following at all.

345
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,300
One thing is for sure.
Math didn't do anything wrong.

346
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,803
<i>She's right.</i>

347
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,723
<i>Math didn't do anything wrong.</i>

348
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,355
<i>No one is guilty, including me and him.</i>

349
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,569
<i>No innocent person should be punished.</i>

350
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:05,118
<i>So, I'm just going to blame math,</i>
<i>knowing it's completely innocent.</i>

351
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:14,085
<i>I'll find a brilliant, creative solution.</i>

352
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,547
<i>A solution that will impress everyone.</i>

353
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,592
<i>One that will help me arrive at the answer</i>

354
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,177
<i>without hurting anyone.</i>

355
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,489
What's going on?

356
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,950
You said you were done
with trying to get your powers back.

357
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,911
You sounded so determined.

358
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,873
Let's go.

359
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:53,958
So-a.

360
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,252
I've been trying...

361
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:03,259
to solve a math problem all day.
You know what math is, right?

362
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,972
I have to find the value of X,

363
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,683
but I can't use
any of the existing formulas.

364
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,771
So, I struggled all day
to come up with a new formula,

365
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,189
and I've finally found the answer.

366
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,863
The answer is...

367
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,119
stopping here.

368
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,086
The answer was already decided for us.

369
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,797
It's time for us to wrap things up

370
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,382
rather than start something new.

371
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,929
I've asked myself how I should end things.

372
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,940
The ending should be beautiful.
We should end things on a positive note.

373
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,532
Help me out here.

374
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,743
Only then...

375
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,372
can I live as a lesser, not a loser.

376
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,670
Then...

377
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,756
what do you want me to do?

378
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,386
Treat me like...

379
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,055
you used to before yesterday.

380
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,730
Let's go.

381
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,639
-You're heading out early again?
-Yes.

382
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,225
The clinic now opens two hours earlier.

383
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,688
I had to change the hours
to sort out someone's mess.

384
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,650
-What do you mean?
-It's better that you don't know.

385
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,860
Even if you knew,

386
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,364
there wouldn't really be anything
that you could do.

387
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,326
Those smug eyes of yours are making me
want to challenge you.

388
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,789
Fine. I'll do everything in my power
to help you until I leave.

389
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,375
-What do you need?
-Money?

390
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,545
Forget what I just said.

391
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,633
Shouldn't we throw a farewell party
for you before you leave?

392
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,594
Treat me to a nice meal.

393
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,179
You'll become a king soon.

394
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,722
I can't because I have no money.

395
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,850
Gosh,
then why don't you go earn some money?

396
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,018
What?

397
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:13,032
HABAEK
YUN SO-A

398
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,483
Isn't the human world a pretty fun place?

399
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,402
The High Priest said the exact same thing.

400
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,029
Is it because of that girl?

401
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,282
Is that why you don't look happy,
even after finding the sacred stone?

402
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,452
And is that why Mura seems so anxious?

403
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,080
I can understand Mura.

404
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,291
While you were going through that,

405
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,002
we were as sad and distressed as you were.

406
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,588
And Mura hated that woman
to begin with, you know.

407
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,631
-Enough.
-But you know what?

408
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,092
You're probably not aware of it,

409
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,678
but I've always been on your side.

410
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,306
You've always made the right choices,

411
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,933
even if they ended in tragedy.

412
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,897
Do you know what the core difference
between humans and us is?

413
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,818
Humans live such short lives. That's why
they can avoid harsh criticism at times,

414
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,403
even when they break the rules.

415
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,406
Especially when it's done
out of love for someone.

416
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,700
They gladly hold even red-hot stones

417
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,328
when they realize that life is very short,

418
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,998
saying "Life is so short."

419
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,419
Well, that girl is an exception, though.

420
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,715
Now, shall we talk about
why you're hesitating?

421
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,761
Is what you're feeling now...

422
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,515
sympathy towards humans or love?

423
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,852
You're not sure.

424
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,690
But you know what? That's how
it began for you even back then.

425
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,193
And the end of it...

426
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,529
was nothing but disgrace.

427
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,782
Even that, I support.
I've already told you.

428
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:22,954
Mura said she'd treat me
to a delicious lunch today.

429
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,622
I wonder where she'll take me.

430
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,803
-Can we really be doing this?
-I don't know.

431
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,058
Answer me. Who is that guy?

432
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,978
I said I don't know.
I should've gotten my wife to do this.

433
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,690
I actually want to punch Biryeom
more than that guy.

434
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,776
Don't say things like that!
He might hear us.

435
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,694
Why can't he do it himself?

436
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,323
-Gosh.
-My gosh!

437
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,661
What's going on? Isn't he human?

438
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,746
I'm not sure. He must be human, though.

439
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,997
Look at all the blood.

440
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,415
-What does he want?
-Oh, no.

441
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,687
Wait! It's me.

442
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,240
Isn't that Jugeollin?

443
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,284
Get out of here!

444
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,869
Come on. Let's get out of here!

445
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,088
I visited those lowly deities

446
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:23,301
to get some food from them,
but something seemed strange.

447
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,305
I overheard them talking about this place,
so I followed them just in case.

448
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,016
You're bleeding a lot.

449
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,772
Why on earth did they do this to me?

450
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,738
<i>I sent them.</i>

451
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,449
That's right. We're different from you.

452
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,117
<i>That's us.</i>

453
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,244
<i>But those who just beat you up</i>

454
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,787
are at the bottom of the barrel.

455
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,914
They have no interest in returning,

456
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,249
and they have nothing to lose.

457
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,502
It's not enough to get back at you
for what you did to my friend,

458
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,546
but let's call it even now.

459
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,089
<i>And...</i>

460
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,388
if you forget your place
and threaten me one more time,

461
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,809
I certainly won't let it slide.

462
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,936
Why are you doing this to me?

463
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,521
Why?

464
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,319
Don't look at me like that.

465
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,279
Just because you don't want
to get your revenge

466
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,198
doesn't mean I have to forgive him.

467
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,329
What on earth are you doing
at this barbaric place?

468
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,373
Hey, you.

469
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,628
Give this a try.

470
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,589
Then you'll learn
how petty our powers are.

471
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,521
Since when did he stop talking?

472
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,481
Ever since you froze his tongue
and crushed it.

473
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,609
But he has a twin brother.

474
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,361
Was his name Momyeong?

475
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,405
Didn't he come with him?

476
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,949
Actually, I haven't seen him
for hundreds of years.

477
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,243
Let's go.

478
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,548
I don't think it's a good idea
to meet him.

479
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,343
You said you'd never become
a dark person.

480
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,764
Hu-ye.

481
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,524
Hey, be careful!
You're going to cross the centerline.

482
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,723
How does it feel to eat
because of hunger...

483
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,560
compared to when you used to eat
just for fun?

484
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,148
That's why you should return soon.

485
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,568
It doesn't look like he wants to go back.

486
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,659
Hey.

487
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,787
What? A house?

488
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,290
No, just cancel it.

489
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,294
Excuse me.

490
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,926
Our servant must be very persuasive.

491
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,845
I heard he gave the land back to her.

492
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,306
The project went down the drain,

493
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,184
and many board members
are angry about what happened.

494
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,188
What? What are you talking about?

495
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,776
How is it that you always know everything?

496
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,571
I don't have much to do, you know.

497
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,950
From the way he acted,

498
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,495
it didn't seem like
he'd give up the land so easily.

499
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,040
I wonder how So-a managed
to convince a guy like him.

500
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,254
I can see that the land isn't the issue.

501
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,882
If you don't want to do
the dirty work yourself,

502
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,384
just tell me.

503
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,344
I know of many ways to harm him.

504
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,346
Why is he so twisted?

505
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,889
He was always like that.

506
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,811
Why? Did he cause trouble again?

507
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,772
I have no idea what they're talking about.

508
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,482
They're making me feel so left out.

509
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,527
So? When are you planning to return?

510
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,653
Jeez.

511
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,780
Are you a broken record?

512
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,700
Stop saying the same thing
over and over again. It's annoying.

513
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,411
He's not a kid.
He'll return when the time comes.

514
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,537
I'm sure he knows...

515
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,831
what will happen to him
if he doesn't return.

516
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,044
I'm off.

517
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,631
-You said you have to go somewhere.
-Yes, it'll take a few days.

518
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,009
Stay until I come back.
Don't leave before then.

519
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,761
-You don't need to wait for him.
-See you when you're back.

520
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,441
<i>From the way he acted,</i>

521
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,860
<i>it didn't seem like</i>
<i>he'd give up the land so easily.</i>

522
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,654
<i>I wonder how So-a managed</i>
<i>to convince a guy like him.</i>

523
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,906
She'll become...

524
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,659
the first and strongest desire
I've ever had

525
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,203
since my life in this world began.

526
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,289
What kind of nonsense
are you saying right now?

527
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,125
-She is a divine servant.
-So what?

528
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,586
You said you're going to return
to your world.

529
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,714
Ms. Yun referred to you
as a wind that's passing by.

530
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,715
No.

531
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,217
She said that the wind
has stopped blowing.

532
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,980
Why do you keep acting like that
towards Habaek?

533
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,900
You're one incorrigible jerk.

534
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,235
You haven't changed one bit
since you were little.

535
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,072
You've always been so rude,
irresponsible, and bullheaded.

536
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,740
Don't you think you're overreacting?

537
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,410
I can say things like that to Habaek,
considering our relationship.

538
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,580
That's exactly what I mean.

539
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,999
Habaek is letting it slide
because it's between you and him.

540
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,835
If you were just a lowly deity,

541
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,171
and if this wasn't a quarrel
between you and Habaek,

542
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,924
the Land of Water would never
forgive you for being so rude.

543
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,471
Are you mad because I provoked Habaek?

544
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,973
Or is it because Habaek might

545
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,185
use what I said as an excuse
and stay here until the very last day?

546
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,652
Stop beating around the bush
and get straight to the point.

547
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,988
Don't act all mature
like you used to in the old days.

548
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,782
What do you mean?

549
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,617
Admit that you feel insecure
because of So-a.

550
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,120
You're worried
that Habaek might already like her.

551
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,622
You've lost him once.
I know you don't want to lose him again.

552
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,582
Just be honest and ask me for help,

553
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,585
-like you always did.
-Have you lost your mind?

554
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,382
I'm also fond of So-a,

555
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,218
but I'll always choose you over her.

556
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,554
So, don't worry and just say
you need my help.

557
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,930
I can do many things.

558
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,811
Biryeom... why are you being like this?

559
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,523
You see,

560
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,067
you always acted as you pleased,

561
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,195
but you were never this anxious.

562
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,867
Is it Shin Hu-ye?

563
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,580
Have you changed because of that halfie?
That's it, isn't it?

564
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:53,876
What did he do...

565
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,919
to provoke you?

566
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,089
There must be something
I don't know about.

567
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,076
Thank you, young man.

568
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,419
Wait up.

569
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,345
Wait a second.

570
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,858
My gosh, this is a nice one.

571
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,045
Oh, boy.

572
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,048
Yes, that's it. Over there.

573
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,178
SCRAP METAL, PAPER, USED CLOTHES

574
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,602
Here.

575
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,688
You worked hard,
so you deserve to get paid.

576
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,856
My goodness.

577
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,904
You've never worked before, right?

578
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,488
This must be your first time
earning money.

579
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,450
I've lived long enough,
so I can see through most people.

580
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,702
People usually buy red long johns

581
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,288
for their parents
when they get their first paychecks.

582
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,374
But you don't have parents, do you?

583
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,960
Always do your best.

584
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,380
Then, eventually,
something amazing will fall into your lap.

585
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,760
A while ago, I found a diamond ring

586
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,387
and took it to a police officer.

587
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,473
I'll be happy if the owner shows up,

588
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,767
and I'll be even happier
if no one claims it.

589
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,448
Come have a look.

590
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:17,955
Aren't they cute?

591
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,374
My friend and I designed them together.

592
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,959
This.

593
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,461
They say that drinking from chipped mugs
can bring bad luck.

594
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,132
Is this enough?

595
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,551
No, it's not.

596
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,055
100 PERCENT HANDMADE

597
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,432
Do you want a photo of me holding it?

598
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,739
Can we book your appointment
for next Wednesday?

599
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,907
Sure. I'll see you next week, then.

600
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,577
All right. Have a good day.

601
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,621
Wednesday.

602
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,126
-She's booked for next Wednesday, right?
-Yes.

603
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,546
-We'll be able to pay this month's rent.
-Really?

604
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,132
Mr. Ma recommended our clinic
to many of his acquaintances.

605
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,343
All the new patients we've been getting
these days are his acquaintances.

606
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,016
WATER DEMON

607
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,101
Are you not going to answer it?

608
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,022
Hello?

609
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,401
-One iced Americano, please.
-Sure.

610
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,072
One iced latte, please.

611
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,931
Why does he keep looking around
like a little kid?

612
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,519
He must be really curious about something.

613
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,896
Now, I can tell just by looking at him.

614
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,927
Why were you looking around?

615
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,180
-Do you want something to drink?
-No, thanks.

616
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,890
Then I'll just order whatever.

617
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,816
One Americano
and one iced Americano, please.

618
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,617
-Here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

619
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,384
What's this? Why is this water black?

620
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,469
I see other drinks with nice colors.

621
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,430
-You seemed curious.
-Me?

622
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,473
That's not true.

623
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,767
Maybe I was just thinking it's weird.

624
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,187
There are so many other colors.

625
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,479
Why get me this black water?

626
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,732
You're so chatty today.

627
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,401
You're never this chatty,
so you rambling on like this

628
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,695
probably means there's something
you want to tell me,

629
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,114
and you're hesitating to say it
for some reason.

630
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,825
-Isn't it too bitter for you?
-It is.

631
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,661
It's bitter and sour, but I also taste
a little bit of sweetness.

632
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,955
You have a sensitive palate.

633
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,459
It tastes unusual, but not bad.
I should come here often.

634
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:36,838
Jeez, whatever.
So, what is it that you want to tell me?

635
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,763
What is this?

636
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,271
Is this for me?

637
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,233
Is this a gift?

638
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,734
You said broken cups bring bad luck.

639
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,862
Don't be so touched by this.

640
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,531
I'm only trying to help you
know your place.

641
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,575
-What?
-Watch.

642
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,080
This is you.

643
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,499
You're wagging your tail
because you saw your master.

644
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,753
This is your master.

645
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,381
-And you, the servant.
-"The servant"?

646
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,299
So, this is you?

647
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,593
Yes. This is probably
getting you all riled up.

648
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,846
Hence the name Yongyong the Angry Dragon.
I came up with that name.

649
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,475
I want you to remember that you're
my servant every time you use it.

650
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,143
Goodness!

651
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,867
You're embarrassing me.

652
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,498
Then what's this? Does this mean
that you're going to be <i>my </i>servant?

653
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,042
Yongyong.

654
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,253
Yongyong.

655
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,672
-Yongyong.
-Give it back.

656
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,923
Hey, it's mine.

657
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,718
You can't take them back.
They're mine now.

658
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,679
Where did you get the money to buy these?

659
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,806
Did Namsuri give you some spending money?

660
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,310
I worked two part-time jobs.

661
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,477
You did what?

662
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,323
You collected waste cardboard
and sold it?

663
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:27,949
And...

664
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,453
I let people take photos of me.

665
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,122
They gave me a few as a souvenir.

666
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,126
Are you touched?

667
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,836
Yes, I'm so touched.

668
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,132
And this plush toy is so cute.

669
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,136
I have to go.

670
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,765
What? I just said that it's cute.

671
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,516
I can't even say it's cute?

672
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,644
Yongyong. Leave my cups at my place, okay?

673
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,979
He's so unobservant.

674
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,273
How did he not notice it
while taking the photos?

675
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,400
I guess he only sees what he wants to see.

676
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,570
<i>Dr. Yun, I'm off.</i>

677
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,572
Will you really be okay?

678
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,492
Why don't you ask Mr. Shin
to come half an hour early?

679
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,286
-Just go.
-It's just that Hyeong-sik--

680
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,204
I said just go.

681
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,830
See you tomorrow.

682
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,459
He always uses Hyeong-sik as an excuse.

683
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,544
Then introduce me to him at least.

684
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,097
DR. YUN SO-A

685
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,344
<i>if you forget your place</i>
<i>and threaten me one more time,</i>

686
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,013
<i>I certainly won't let it slide.</i>

687
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,817
<i>Habaek is just as you saw.</i>
<i>And as for me, it's pretty simple.</i>

688
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:28,695
I hate you.

689
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,115
And I will continue to hate you very much.

690
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,158
Because...

691
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,493
I'm different from you guys?

692
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,081
Let's just say that, halfie.

693
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,676
<i>I heard all you can do</i>
<i>is destroy people and things.</i>

694
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,803
You don't like gods.

695
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,472
I heard you've killed a few.

696
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,973
That's not true.

697
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,808
Did you want to prove
that you're a god too,

698
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,311
albeit a halfie?

699
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,074
DR. YUN SO-A

700
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,041
I wonder if he's okay.

701
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,840
Did you come alone?

702
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,844
May I join you?

703
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,143
Oh, I think someone keeps calling you.

704
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,905
DR. YUN SO-A

705
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:03,957
Hello?

706
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,627
Mr. Shin, why aren't you here yet?

707
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,588
<i>Hello?</i>

708
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,298
I'm sorry.

709
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,510
Shall we reschedule your appointment
if you can't make it today?

710
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,429
No, I'll leave now. I'm sorry.

711
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,770
Is he under the weather?

712
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,990
When do you plan to return
to the Land of Water?

713
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,577
Are you really going to wait
until Lord Judong comes back?

714
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,583
I guess Ms. Descendant
is coming home late today.

715
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,968
WATER DEMON

716
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,057
-Hello?
-<i>Why aren't you coming home?</i>

717
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,227
I'm still at work.
My last patient is running late.

718
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,146
He'll be here soon, so I'll--

719
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,690
Mr. Shin. I have to go.

720
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,613
<i>Mr. Shin.</i>

721
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,200
Mr. Shin.

722
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,582
Did he drink and drive?

723
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,167
Mr. Shin.

724
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,753
Try to sober up. My gosh!

725
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,441
-Give me some money.
-Pardon?

726
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,462
Mr. Shin.

727
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,838
Mr. Shin.

728
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,882
Please wake up.

729
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,388
What should I do?

730
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,933
I can't give him a fever reducer
because he's been drinking.

731
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,171
<i>We don't care either.</i>

732
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,423
<i>However, there's something</i>
<i>I need to check.</i>

733
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,800
If what I'm thinking is right,

734
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:47,096
you'll be proving that you are indeed
the legendary monster.

735
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,731
His fever isn't going down.

736
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,244
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

737
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,391
Mr. Shin...

738
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,525
Ms. Yun.

739
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:48,950
I'm sorry.

740
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,261
<i>Can I be irresponsible?</i>

741
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,929
<i>-What are we?</i>
<i>-You asked me what we are.</i>

742
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,765
<i>-Does someone like me...</i>
-<i>If I must ask a favor of you...</i>

743
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,392
<i>Does someone like me...</i>

744
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,936
<i>-Should I ask you to make him stay...</i>
<i>-...deserve a woman like her?</i>

745
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,605
<i>...or let him go?</i>

746
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,398
<i>-I want to hold you in my arms...</i>
<i>-You may not.</i>

747
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,858
<i>and kiss you.</i>

748
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,068
<i>Let's just stay like this.</i>

749
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,154
<i>However much I think about it,</i>
<i>my answer is no.</i>

750
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:12,033
<i>-I want you to be my first...</i>
<i>-I'm asking you to let Habaek go.</i>

751
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,367
<i>...and last.</i>

752
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,161
<i>That fool is in love with you.</i>

753
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,746
<i>So would it be okay to begin?</i>
