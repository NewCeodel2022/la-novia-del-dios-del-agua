1
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,194
Jingeon.

2
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,156
I told you to stay out of this!

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,422
You're...

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,510
Yes. Do you get it now?

5
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,597
Do you remember who you killed?

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,849
Do you now realize what your sin is?

7
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,068
What does that mean?

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,537
<i>There's one more thing that annoys me.</i>

9
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,831
It's the thought of you
hanging out with him,

10
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,209
despite knowing who he really is.

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>Explain?</i>

12
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,549
Did you know about him?

13
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,968
-Know what?
-This guy's identity.

14
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,145
No way.

15
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,982
I thought I was mistaken.

16
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,449
What do you mean by that?

17
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,120
Whom did he kill?

18
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,005
Is it Momyeong?

19
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,842
Did he kill Momyeong?

20
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,512
It's childish, but I thought
I should give him a chance.

21
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,765
Although nothing would've changed
even with a proper answer.

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,018
You said you only tell the truth.

23
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,937
<i>I don't lie.</i>

24
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,981
I'm not immature.

25
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,986
I only speak the truth.

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,708
For the past 1,200 years,

27
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,710
I've killed you in my head
countless times.

28
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,380
You probably have no idea how much
I wanted our powers to be swapped.

29
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,633
Then this thought hit me.

30
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,678
You had to live through
the endless vicious cycle

31
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,763
of life and death in that cave
for thousands of years.

32
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,099
The thought of you rotting like that...

33
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,102
made me realize that it's probably
the sweetest revenge.

34
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,813
But...

35
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,067
you get to see the sun
and breathe like this?

36
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,403
How dare you breathe and smile?

37
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,614
Stop it.

38
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:29,918
That's enough.

39
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,712
He's not picking up.

40
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,800
When did he meet him for the first time?

41
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,969
And what? For the past 1,200 years?

42
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,221
Also, the cave. What does that mean?

43
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,852
Do you think Jingeon will be okay?

44
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,063
I think he stopped his power
in the middle of it.

45
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,316
Had he used it fully,
it would've been very bad.

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,567
And who's Momyeong?

47
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,736
You don't know him?

48
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,281
His twin brother.

49
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,991
He was like Biryeom's shadow.

50
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,244
Biryeom was so fond of him.

51
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,750
At some point, I realized
that he was nowhere to be seen.

52
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,753
I had no idea that was what happened.

53
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,797
I should've paid more attention.

54
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,429
Don't feel guilty.

55
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,307
You've always been indifferent
toward Biryeom.

56
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,977
Why didn't he tell me, though?

57
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,730
Can't you see that I can't tell you
because it's you?

58
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,816
Because you're the one asking me
for an explanation...

59
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,237
Why...

60
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,406
Why did he...

61
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,410
-kill Momyeong?
-I don't know.

62
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,290
I'm very disappointed in Mr. Shin.

63
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,510
<i>You gods think of yourselves as saviors.</i>

64
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,387
<i>But what can you do to me?</i>

65
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,222
<i>Do you plan to kill me or what?</i>

66
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,724
<i>Can you do...</i>

67
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,226
a better job in doing that than I can?

68
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,436
<i>For the past 1,200 years,</i>

69
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,646
<i>I've killed you in my head</i>
<i>countless times.</i>

70
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,400
<i>You had to live through</i>
<i>the endless vicious cycle of</i>

71
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,444
<i>life and death in that cave</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

72
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,404
<i>The thought of you rotting like that</i>

73
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,783
<i>made me realize that it's probably</i>
<i>the sweetest revenge.</i>

74
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,410
But...

75
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,290
you get to see the sun
and breathe like this?

76
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,794
<i>How dare you breathe and smile?</i>

77
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,211
MR. SHIN HU-YE

78
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,056
Don't worry.

79
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,641
Biryeom pulled a prank.

80
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,144
-He'll sort it out with his--
-He's like you guys, isn't he?

81
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,313
I'm talking about Mr. Shin.

82
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,399
He's from your world, isn't he?

83
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,904
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Did I have to tell you?

84
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,906
-Sorry?
-You never asked.

85
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,536
He's not like us.

86
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,747
But...

87
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,044
It must've been you guys.

88
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,963
-What?
-I'm sure of it.

89
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,008
Those who told Mr. Shin
that he shouldn't have been born.

90
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,092
Since when...

91
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,888
were you two close enough
to talk about such things?

92
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,097
Why did you say that?

93
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,433
Why did you guys criticize him like that?

94
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,018
You guys are gods. Gods should--

95
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,561
Did it start after I left?

96
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,563
Or was it before that?

97
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,650
Were you hoping that I'd leave?

98
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,739
You said you're lesser...

99
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,033
because you tolerate everything.

100
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,576
But...

101
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,579
were you crying like a loser?

102
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,790
Is that why you opened up to him
so quickly?

103
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,298
Why are you being like this?

104
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,216
Didn't I tell you?

105
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,052
I told you to bear in mind

106
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,138
that I can be very jealous
of your male friends

107
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,183
and that I'm not rational.

108
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,834
<i>When did he meet him for the first time?</i>

109
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,796
And what? For the past 1,200 years?

110
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,507
Also, the cave. What does that mean?

111
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,682
Nak-bin is hiding in the Land of the Sky.

112
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,269
I heard she is in one of the caves
that the King owns.

113
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,605
-Can you ask around?
-It won't make any difference.

114
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,609
No place in the divine realm
would be safe for her.

115
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,945
The same goes for the human world.

116
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,738
I'm not trying to rescue her.

117
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,157
And I'll never forgive her.

118
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,577
It's just there's something
I want to know.

119
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,744
What do you want to know?

120
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,038
I want to ask her...

121
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,708
what I was to her.

122
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,419
That can't be.

123
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,450
-Hey, Yeom-mi.
-<i>What is it now?</i>

124
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,409
Well...

125
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,745
There is someone called A.

126
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,663
Go on.

127
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,916
Why would A suddenly overreact
and get upset during a conversation?

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,668
-Break up with him.
-What?

129
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,503
<i>I'm sure A is a guy.</i>

130
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,463
What?

131
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,841
-Yes.
-<i>He must have anger management issues.</i>

132
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,885
Gosh. No, he doesn't.

133
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,178
<i>Then he's just a jerk.</i>

134
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,431
-No, he isn't. Not at all.
-<i>He feels guilty about something.</i>

135
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,850
-What?
-<i>Guys are like that.</i>

136
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,812
When they realize that they did
something wrong, they get angry.

137
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,898
That's how they test women's patience.

138
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,775
<i>Break up with him.</i>

139
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,580
-Hello.
-<i>Dr. Yun, this is Mr. Min.</i>

140
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,626
-Oh, hello.
-<i>Have you heard from Mr. Shin at all?</i>

141
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,089
No. He's not at work yet?

142
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,590
<i>I see. All right.</i>

143
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,884
<i>Please call me</i>
<i>if you hear anything from him.</i>

144
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,094
Okay, I will.

145
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,812
MR. SHIN HU-YE

146
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,819
DR. YUN SO-A

147
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,703
<i>I've found Biryeom.</i>

148
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,633
Tell me.

149
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,261
That day,

150
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,848
you went to that cave, didn't you?

151
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,183
Did you...

152
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,768
meet that guy there?

153
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,521
Is that...

154
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,523
when Momyeong died?

155
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,986
Why didn't you tell me?

156
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,655
You said you weren't there.

157
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,450
You said you wouldn't help me.

158
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,662
I've thought about it,
but I can't help you.

159
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,581
I mean, I don't want to.

160
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,042
You broke Mura's heart.

161
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,462
You don't deserve to be happy.

162
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,090
You need to be punished.

163
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,675
Then...

164
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,720
why did you say you didn't go?

165
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:47,224
Right, I shouldn't have gone.
I've regretted it thousands of times.

166
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,226
"Why did I go there?

167
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,229
Why did I even try to do you a favor?

168
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,150
Was helping you
more important than Momyeong?"

169
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,027
I keep asking myself.

170
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
What happened?

171
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,572
That guy...

172
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,909
Why was he there?

173
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
He had been imprisoned there.

174
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,455
And she happened to be hiding there.

175
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,427
<i>At first, I didn't know he was that kid.</i>

176
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,473
<i>He probably thought</i>
<i>I was taking Nak-bin away.</i>

177
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,608
<i>Right at that moment,</i>
<i>the King's servants came to get her.</i>

178
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,943
What are you doing?

179
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,581
Momyeong...

180
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,925
Momyeong!

181
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,638
Momyeong!

182
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,558
Momyeong!

183
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:00,983
Why...

184
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,526
Why?

185
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,613
Why have you kept it from me
all this time?

186
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,866
It was the King's order.

187
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,582
The King ordered us not to tell anyone
about the boy being there.

188
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,544
As his servants,
we had to follow his order.

189
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,051
So, Momyeong died...

190
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,056
because of me.

191
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,311
With all due respect,
it's no one's fault that Momyeong died.

192
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,731
Momyeong and I share one fate
since we're twins.

193
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:46,820
One of us was destined to die
sooner or later.

194
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,994
Yes, it's your fault.

195
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,917
I personally don't think
you deserve a slap,

196
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,086
but Biryeom has been wanting to punch you.

197
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,423
Let's go. You were right.

198
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,300
It does feel nice to slap him.

199
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,658
Let it go.

200
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,288
I know something is weighing on your mind.

201
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,625
You resent Habaek...

202
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,629
and find it hard to forgive Mr. Shin.

203
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,131
And...

204
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,635
you hate yourself on top of that.
It's all because of this, isn't it?

205
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,721
-What are you talking about?
-You think you ran away.

206
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,517
You think you abandoned Momyeong.

207
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,687
That's why you can't forgive yourself

208
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,480
and hate everything.

209
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,944
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,746
I'm the one who should feel most guilty.

211
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,789
Don't you think so?

212
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,461
I told you to run away
if you ever saw him.

213
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,005
The God of Fire?

214
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,507
He should be our blacksmith.

215
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,675
Cut it out.

216
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,013
If you ever see him,
run as fast as you can.

217
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,681
He'd definitely be stronger than you.

218
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,521
Did those words...

219
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,315
get your back up?

220
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,071
-No.
-You didn't run away.

221
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,199
Jingeon dragged you out of there
against your will.

222
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,661
You don't know anything.

223
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,996
However...

224
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,089
part of you wanted to run away.

225
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,050
Part of you was grateful
that Jingeon got you out of there.

226
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,970
Is that what you've been thinking?

227
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,812
This is why I always say
that you're immature.

228
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,900
You didn't abandon Momyeong.
You saved Jingeon's life.

229
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,070
If something bad happened to you that day,

230
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,114
Jingeon wouldn't be in one piece now.

231
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,659
Do you think the Land of the Sky
would've forgiven him?

232
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,290
Don't take my advice from now on.

233
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,252
There are always
unintended consequences like this.

234
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,296
And...

235
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,134
just think of this...

236
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,679
as the greatest consolation
I can give you.

237
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,462
-Feel better now?
-Are you kidding me?

238
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,037
<i>He had been imprisoned there.</i>

239
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,081
<i>And she happened to be hiding there.</i>

240
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,594
Mr. Shin.

241
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,017
I know that you're here.

242
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,936
I can feel that you're here.

243
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,441
Are we playing hide-and-seek now?

244
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,533
I fell.

245
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,369
Is he not here?

246
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,121
That's odd.

247
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,588
Damn it!

248
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>He's not like us.</i>

249
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,807
He's not one of them?

250
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,935
Then what is he?

251
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,856
He's from the world of gods,
but he's not a god?

252
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,443
<i>I don't know who my mother is.</i>

253
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,695
My father...

254
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,615
treated me like a monster.

255
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,368
I wasn't supposed to be born.

256
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,410
Disgrace.

257
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,540
That was my name.

258
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,669
My father was afraid
people would find out about me,

259
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,756
so he chose to imprison me
for a long time.

260
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,597
The notion of family is different
in the divine realm.

261
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,768
He said the notion of family
is different in the world of gods.

262
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,106
Could it be...

263
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:22,901
No way.

264
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,862
That can't be.

265
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,464
What am I going to do...

266
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,300
when I see him?

267
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,812
Are you going somewhere?

268
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,522
No.

269
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,323
I'm sorry about last night.

270
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,457
Did something happen?

271
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,834
No.

272
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,005
-Well...
-Yes?

273
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,717
Never mind.

274
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,760
Where were you all day?

275
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,307
Did you meet your friends
and try to borrow money from them?

276
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,187
The reality must've hit you.

277
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,648
Food.

278
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,778
You still remember it.

279
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,407
Let's eat something. How about curry?

280
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,868
-What is that?
-You'll see. It's yellow.

281
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,078
I'll go pick up some curry paste.

282
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,080
Peel some potatoes, please.

283
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,667
Do a good job, okay?

284
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,804
How to peel potatoes.

285
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,599
HOW TO PEEL POTATOES

286
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,563
Hello?

287
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,357
The potatoes are sprouting.

288
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,400
The sprouts are playing
rock-paper-scissors.

289
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,360
What?

290
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,280
All right.

291
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,909
Is he addicted to surfing the internet?

292
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,787
JAHA MART

293
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,913
Do you have potatoes?

294
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,727
How ugly.

295
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,909
HOW TO MAKE CURRY

296
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,870
Curry...

297
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,040
And...

298
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,836
I bought the curry paste...

299
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,671
and potatoes.

300
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,590
The curry paste is here. Potatoes and...

301
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,968
And bell peppers.

302
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,002
HOW TO MAKE CURRY

303
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,073
Hold on! Calm down.

304
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,409
It's me. You don't recognize me?

305
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,453
I'm the one who kissed Habaek.

306
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,748
It's you.

307
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,668
Yes, I'm the voracious deity, Jugeollin.

308
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,552
Hold on.

309
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,012
Hear me out.

310
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,055
Hear me out first.

311
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,642
I want you to see Hu-ye.

312
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,521
Please.

313
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,034
Mr. Shin.

314
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,713
Mr. Shin.

315
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,257
-Just a moment.
-Let go.

316
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,009
-Look at me.
-Let go of me!

317
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,343
Stay still.

318
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,639
It's okay.

319
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,850
It's all right.

320
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,102
Stay still.

321
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,898
<i>It's okay.</i>

322
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,691
<i>Stay still.</i>

323
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,581
-Yun--
-<i>Yes, it's me.</i>

324
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,624
Where are you?

325
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,460
-Are you okay?
-<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

326
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,836
<i>Don't worry.</i>

327
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:58,922
Is it that prick?

328
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,965
<i>Are you with him right now?</i>

329
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,844
Come home now.

330
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,305
I'm totally fine.

331
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,015
I'll see you later.

332
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,266
<i>Come home now.</i>

333
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,936
You don't even know him.

334
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,272
He's not the kind of person
you think he is.

335
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,608
I know him well enough.

336
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,278
-What?
-<i>So don't worry.</i>

337
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,281
He won't harm me.

338
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,700
I'll be home soon. Don't worry.

339
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,581
See?

340
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,250
She's okay, right?

341
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,630
You thought he'd harm her?
Mr. Shin might be a dangerous man,

342
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,757
but he'd never harm that girl.

343
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,717
-She must be at the farm.
-Just let him have her.

344
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,720
-That'll be better for her too.
-Help me get there.

345
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,347
Think about it.

346
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,141
There is nothing you can do for her.

347
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,144
Mr. Shin is very rich.

348
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,647
It'll take too long by car.

349
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,567
-Help me, please.
-I don't want to.

350
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,545
Mr. Shin.

351
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,089
Leave.

352
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,217
-Mr. Shin.
-Please!

353
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,638
Leave, please.

354
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,979
Don't come near me.

355
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,023
I destroy everything.

356
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,734
If you stay with me...

357
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,279
you'll be unhappy.

358
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,116
I almost...

359
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,289
killed you once.

360
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,297
Some things never change.

361
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,008
Even if you change its appearance,

362
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,637
it just never changes.

363
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,140
No matter how hard you try,

364
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,602
you keep going back.

365
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,064
You go back...

366
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,359
again and again.

367
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,152
So...

368
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,946
where did you begin?

369
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,911
Are you trying to say...

370
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,914
that your sins will never disappear?

371
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,873
That's right.

372
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,502
I am capable of...

373
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,047
committing another sin anytime.

374
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,175
-I'll never change.
-You're wrong.

375
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,678
You're not that kind of person.

376
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,432
"Person"?

377
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,185
Then would you rather be a god?

378
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,607
What would you rather be?
A god or a human being?

379
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,237
Be a human being.

380
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,280
That's better.

381
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,324
A human being...

382
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,493
suits you better.

383
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,874
You've helped so many people.
You've supported so many children.

384
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,420
You've helped countless ill people
get better.

385
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,132
You've saved so many lives.

386
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,261
Do you know what you are to those people?

387
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,847
You're like a god to them.

388
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,309
The work you've done as a human being...

389
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,980
was the work of a god.

390
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,193
Let's say God is looking down from above.

391
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:54,741
He'd see a tiny human being
helping other humans

392
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,869
in a tiny country,
on this tiny planet called Earth.

393
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,499
God would say, "I'm so busy.

394
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,460
Thank you for helping me out.

395
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,754
Well done.

396
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,048
My blessing upon you."

397
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,802
I once told you...

398
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,681
that all the trees you planted
will become a big forest one day.

399
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,435
The life you've been living...

400
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,521
will never disappear.

401
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,570
If you choose to be a human being,

402
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,238
I will be...

403
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,365
on your side.

404
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,369
No matter...

405
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,246
what happens,

406
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,915
I'll always be on your side.

407
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,046
I'll be...

408
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,633
your god.

409
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,441
But I'm...

410
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,320
So-a.

411
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,370
Let's go.

412
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,564
I'm his psychiatrist.

413
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,281
Is this jealousy?

414
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,081
I suppose this is better
than having no jealousy at all.

415
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,917
But I've never been with a guy
who's the jealous type,

416
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,880
so I can't really tell
if this is jealousy or not.

417
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,532
You haven't eaten anything?

418
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,619
I can tell you're hungry.

419
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,412
It's too late for curry.

420
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,123
I'm sorry, but we'll just have to have
some cup noodles.

421
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,783
Wait.

422
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,183
-What was that about?
-Let's stop there.

423
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,394
-What?
-I said, no more.

424
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,187
But why?

425
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,192
"Why?"

426
00:37:59,068 --> 00:37:59,944
Never mind.

427
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,406
-Shall we continue?
-No.

428
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,534
Candy...

429
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,577
must not be eaten all at once.

430
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,579
-Sorry?
-I'll see you tomorrow.

431
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,753
What did he just say?

432
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,301
What's this about?
Is he trying to train me or what?

433
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,554
He's acting like a total womanizer.

434
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,463
All right. 10,001, 10,002, 10,003...

435
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,299
-Lord Habaek.
-Keep going.

436
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,720
Okay. 10,009, 10,010.

437
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,558
My Lord, why are you being like this?

438
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,404
This fruit juice quenches thirst
like nothing else does.

439
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,906
That totally hydrated me.

440
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,976
-What was that about?
-Let's stop there.

441
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,354
-What?
-I said, no more.

442
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,022
But why?

443
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,526
Gosh, why on earth did I say that?

444
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,395
-What's up?
-What?

445
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,148
Nothing. Don't mind me.

446
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,899
Why are you all wet?

447
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,070
I'm sweating. It's such a nuisance.
I need to use the place called "bathroom."

448
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,321
What did you say?

449
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,699
Why do you need to use my bathroom?

450
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,075
You have that rubber bin.

451
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,327
You told me not to sit in it all the time.

452
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,495
What? Oh, right.

453
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,206
Well, what I meant was...

454
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,208
Where is it? Upstairs?

455
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,306
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

456
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,057
I have to go to work.

457
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,435
Really?
Then let's come home together later.

458
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,436
What?

459
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,855
Okay, sure.

460
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,404
Gosh, I must be losing my mind.

461
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,741
That man...

462
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,661
What the heck did he do to me last night?

463
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,505
MR. SHIN HU-YE

464
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,256
<i>Can we meet briefly?</i>

465
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,259
<i>You should see how your patient</i>
<i>is doing after our session, Doctor.</i>

466
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,240
PROPOSAL

467
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,575
CEO SHIN HU-YE

468
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,035
Can you go to Songdo?

469
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,747
They're saying they need me there,
but I think you can take care of it.

470
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,457
-Mr. Kim will fill you in.
-Sure.

471
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,265
-What brings you here?
-What?

472
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,272
If it's about Block World,
I have nothing more to tell you.

473
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,692
You should let your grandfather know.

474
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:50,859
Okay.

475
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,654
But that's not why I'm here.
I was just wondering...

476
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,031
Are you busy?

477
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,540
Do you need to talk to Mr. Min?

478
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,543
Yes.

479
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,504
Why? Why have you been ignoring my calls?

480
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,339
You know I called you so many times,
right?

481
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,300
-I didn't want to talk to you.
-Why not?

482
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,051
Tell me, Mr. Min.

483
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,139
-Am I supposed to talk like a counselor?
-What? Yes.

484
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,475
Are you the one who told Dr. Yun
to vacate the office space?

485
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,435
What?

486
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,229
Yes. How did you know?

487
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,231
That's not why I gave you the information.

488
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,525
How dare you misuse the information?
You're shameless.

489
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,818
"Shameless"?

490
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,987
Is that why you're mad at me?

491
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,449
Do you like her too? Is that it?

492
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,908
I don't like anyone.

493
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,995
I just want you to become
a decent human being.

494
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,330
"A decent human being"?

495
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,833
Don't contact me until you think
you've become a decent human being.

496
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,585
No more counseling for you.

497
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm busy. I have to go.

498
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,215
And your plan has failed.

499
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,887
Become a decent human being?

500
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,973
That jerk!

501
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,939
The flowers we planted
have already grown this much?

502
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,566
I've been watering them every day.

503
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,653
Butterflies also came by
and gave them love.

504
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,155
That's why the flowers
could bloom like this.

505
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,658
Min, you're so smart.

506
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,119
Don't grow up too fast.

507
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,663
I'll be bored.

508
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,964
-I see that you have a guest.
-Hello.

509
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,344
Hi.

510
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,979
Min, say hi. She's a doctor.

511
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,232
Hello.

512
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,234
Yes, hi. You have such a pretty name.

513
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,613
Mr. Shin, why is a doctor here?

514
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,323
I'm not sick.

515
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,576
-She's here to see me.
-Really?

516
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,831
Is she Ms. Yun by any chance?

517
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,795
I heard you telling someone on the phone
that you'll keep your promise

518
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,132
and saying, "Yes, Ms. Yun."

519
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,343
I could tell that you were
in a really good mood that day.

520
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,973
-Mr. Shin, you must--
-Min.

521
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:26,890
Yes?

522
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,143
Oh, is it a secret?

523
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,980
No, it's not that.

524
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,950
Min should leave now.

525
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,619
She's my neighbor

526
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,705
and my only friend.

527
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,791
Her parents passed away,
so she lives with her grandmother.

528
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,377
Her grandmother has to see her doctor
twice a month.

529
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,213
She always comes with her
to get some fresh air and so on.

530
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,675
She can draw very well.

531
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,387
I guess she can see everything
with her heart.

532
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,516
Her eyes...

533
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:12,895
It was my doing.

534
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,198
For a few years after coming here,

535
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,034
I didn't know how to control my powers.

536
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,078
Regardless of my intentions,

537
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,332
I had no way of knowing
when and what could happen,

538
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,083
so I was always anxious.

539
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,630
On my first day at the farm,

540
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,758
I saw Min wrapped in a blanket.

541
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,428
When her grandmother stepped out
for a brief moment,

542
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,430
a wild dog attacked her.

543
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,642
I wanted to get the dog off of her,

544
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,520
so I used my power.

545
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,272
The dog died,

546
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,733
and the baby...

547
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,905
She lost her eyesight.

548
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,082
I think of Min's life...

549
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,335
as my own.

550
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:41,817
Ms. Yun.

551
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,821
-I just made up my mind about something.
-Sorry?

552
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,284
"It won't be a bad idea to just enjoy this
regardless of this woman's intentions."

553
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,286
What do you mean?

554
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,456
Well,
you don't need to know the specifics.

555
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,512
Ms. Yun.

556
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,973
Did we perhaps...

557
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,850
cross paths in the past?

558
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,310
Pardon?

559
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,062
Well, it just feels like...

560
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,148
we've crossed paths...

561
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,319
a long time ago.

562
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,529
It's okay.

563
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,698
It's all right.

564
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,075
Stay still.

565
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,954
<i>It's okay.</i>

566
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,623
<i>Stay still.</i>

567
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,010
Sir.

568
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,388
-We're ready for the meeting.
-Okay.

569
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,100
I should go. I'll see you later.

570
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,019
Okay.

571
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,145
What?

572
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,065
"Later"?

573
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,568
Why is she sleeping
when she called me over?

574
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,155
Why are you here again?

575
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,407
What? Me?

576
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,575
Yes, you.

577
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,162
I'm here for my shift.
You told me to just sit here.

578
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,080
What?

579
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,918
What did you say?

580
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,384
What?

581
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,556
What? Speak louder.

582
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,354
He is...

583
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,773
Yes, go on.

584
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,401
-Who are you talking about?
-He is...

585
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,910
He's the one who saved me.

586
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,037
It was him.

587
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,123
But...

588
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:13,802
What?

589
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,138
What are you talking about now?

590
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,399
I can't hear you!

591
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,320
-When did you get here?
-A few minutes ago.

592
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,239
What kind of dream
made you that aggressive?

593
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,991
Gosh, my goodness!

594
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,826
I saw your landlady in my dream.

595
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,955
Why does she have to brag about
her boyfriend even in my dream?

596
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,499
-What?
-I can't believe this.

597
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,918
She's making me feel upset
about the fact that I'm single.

598
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,756
I was even going to do a reading for her,
thinking it might be a bad omen.

599
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:55,135
I can't believe she was bragging
about some man saving her life.

600
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,391
But you must really be helping me boost
my psychic powers.

601
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,185
I can hear things again.

602
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,533
Oh, right. The new owner of the building
will stop by later today.

603
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,578
Really? It's so messy here, though.

604
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,539
-Do we have anything to give him?
-I'll go buy some cold drinks.

605
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,127
Hey, Hyeong-sik.

606
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,379
Why are you crying?

607
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,298
What? Your appendix burst?

608
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,385
Yes, okay. I'll leave right now.

609
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,304
Which hospital are you at?

610
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,305
Hey.

611
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,431
Hey!

612
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,226
Jeez, that slacker.

613
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,626
Why make such a fuss about appendicitis?
My goodness.

614
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,592
He's useless.

615
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,598
Is this the only rag we have?

616
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,604
I wonder if he's on his way here.

617
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,108
I should ask him
if he can bring some rags.

618
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,156
What's wrong with me?

619
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:55,422
WATER DEMON

620
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,132
MY SERVANT

621
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,597
What happened to your face?

622
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,016
<i>Oh, well...</i>

623
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,894
I just did it for fun.

624
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,568
What?

625
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,199
No, it's nothing.

626
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,494
<i>Do you find me attractive?</i>

627
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,045
Well...

628
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,008
<i>Can you bring a few rags</i>
<i>when you're coming?</i>

629
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,347
<i>Am I attractive or not?</i>

630
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,019
-My gosh, I have to go!
-<i>Hey, what's wrong?</i>

631
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,198
Gosh, what did this guy...

632
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,493
do to me last night?

633
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,336
I must be possessed
by some dirty-minded evil spirit.

634
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,840
Why does she keep losing her mind?

635
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,969
How dare she order me to bring rags...

636
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,806
Hey.

637
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,685
How did you get in here?

638
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,979
Don't you think
that question is a little weird?

639
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,773
I can go anywhere. I'm a god.

640
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,653
I didn't want to see you either.

641
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,114
I came because Mura kept insisting
that I should.

642
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,491
She told me to hear what you have to say.

643
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,244
-How's Jingeon?
-He's fine.

644
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,079
No matter what he says,

645
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,082
it is my fault that Momyeong died.

646
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,836
I caused his death.

647
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,755
But I've been living...

648
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,676
without knowing
that he died because of me.

649
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,430
That's why you're so angry.

650
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,600
I'm sorry.

651
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,147
This is what Mura wanted you...

652
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,317
to hear from me, right?

653
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,945
He was probably...

654
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,115
trying to protect Nak-bin.

655
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,578
It must've been his first time seeing
a female human after many years.

656
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,295
I can't think that far yet.
I need some time.

657
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,590
Wait.

658
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,266
Didn't he ask you for money
with this kind of face?

659
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,061
-He did.
-He did?

660
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,687
-So?
-I told him that no one

661
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,397
carries around cash these days.

662
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,441
-And?
-"Then give me your credit card.

663
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,152
If you don't have one,
give me some diamonds.

664
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,614
When I refused, he said,
"This is the King's order."

665
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,451
I'm speechless.
Make sure you never give him any money.

666
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,995
Why don't you stop doing favors for him?

667
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,040
You said you weren't going to take him
to the farm, but you did.

668
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,458
No more favors for him.

669
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,419
I'll hang him out to dry
so that he goes back as soon as possible.

670
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,758
What?

671
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,510
Can I kiss you?

672
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,678
-Must I freeze your tongue?
-Just one kiss.

673
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,679
Start driving.

674
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,642
All right. Do you want to take it
to the next level when we get home?

675
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,161
Should I tell him not to come?

676
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,455
I'll tell him not to come today.

677
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,707
We can go home together starting tomorrow.
My gosh!

678
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,632
NURSE YU

679
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,717
<i>Hyeong-sik is fine.</i>

680
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:14,305
HYEONG-SIK IS FINE

681
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,266
<i>As for picking up drinks</i>
<i>for the new landlord...</i>

682
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,436
Jeez, that slacker!

683
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,563
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

684
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,787
What? "Bring some rags"?

685
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,209
Who does she think I am?

686
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,844
-What are you doing here?
-Hello, how have you been?

687
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,181
That's none of your business.

688
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,476
Why are you here?

689
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,645
-I came to say hello as the new landlord.
-"Landlord"?

690
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,356
What's that?

691
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,486
You don't need to know.
They say landlords are above God.

692
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,404
Landlords can be quite powerful at times.

693
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,782
I don't give a shit. Just get lost.

694
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,580
I've already said this to Ms. Yun,

695
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,957
but I'll say it again.

696
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,835
You see, what I'm best at

697
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,504
-is waiting.
-What?

698
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,923
No one can defy time and gravity.

699
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,258
You have to return
to the divine realm eventually,

700
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,136
but I'll still be living here with her.

701
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,139
So?

702
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,810
I'll do all the things
that you'll never be able

703
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,270
to do with her.

704
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,356
Thankfully,

705
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,316
I have a lot to offer.

706
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:55,823
What did you say?

707
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,578
Excuse me, guys.

708
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,335
What brings you here?
You don't have an appointment today.

709
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,046
-I thought you knew that I was coming.
-What?

710
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,386
You didn't mention anything
when I saw you earlier.

711
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,554
Don't say anything.

712
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,473
Don't talk to him.

713
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,355
Lock the door
and leave the key under the flower pot.

714
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,462
Calm down, will you?
I'm worried we might get into an accident.

715
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,264
Is this also jealousy?

716
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,562
This does feel more like jealousy
than what you did yesterday.

717
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,066
Anyway, you're charming
even when you're jealous.

718
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,160
You're charming even when you're angry.

719
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,042
-Where are we going?
-I don't know.

720
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,294
Do you want to go see the sunset?

721
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,922
Let's hurry. Who knows when someone else
will show up and bother us?

722
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,884
Come on. Let's go.

723
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,211
Over there.
The sun will set in that direction.

724
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,847
Let's watch from here.

725
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,452
This is such a memorable image.
It's the perfect way to end the day.

726
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:51,541
I guess this is why people purposely go
see the sunset even when they're busy.

727
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,755
To tell you the truth,

728
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,884
I came here once with my parents
when I was young.

729
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,222
Back then,
I didn't get this kind of feeling.

730
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,268
My dad kept worrying...

731
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,563
about the kids we left at home,

732
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,232
and my mom was mad at him
for being like that.

733
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,821
They kept arguing nonstop,
and I was on pins and needles.

734
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,367
So we just had a bowl of clam noodles
and went home.

735
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,380
What are you thinking?

736
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,757
Tomorrow,

737
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,677
the day after tomorrow,

738
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,305
and the day after that.

739
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,558
Your future without me.

740
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,647
Let's only think about today.

741
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,485
You said something very impressive
a little while ago.

742
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,279
You told me about those who believe

743
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,032
they can live the rest of their lives
with their memories of today.

744
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,203
I said that?

745
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,371
When?

746
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,459
A while ago.

747
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,320
When something fades in the sun,
it becomes history.

748
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,450
And when something soaks up the moonlight,

749
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,870
it becomes a myth.

750
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,791
That means our story...

751
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,794
will become a myth.

752
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,590
<i>-I've received the message.</i>
<i>-Please get ready, Lord Habaek.</i>

753
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,342
<i>Can I be greedy?</i>

754
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:33,012
<i>Let me say this just in case.</i> <i>You know</i>
<i>what will happen if you don't return?</i>

755
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,597
<i>-Let's stay together.</i>
<i>-All right.</i>

756
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,933
<i>Habaek will perish</i>
<i>if he doesn't ascend the throne.</i>

757
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,684
<i>I don't want that kind of tragedy.</i>

758
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,853
<i>Try your best not to be lonely</i>
<i>for as long as you can.</i>

759
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,271
<i>Can you live without him?</i>

760
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,024
<i>Then let me tell you</i>
<i>something you don't know.</i>

761
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:48,069
<i>He's the one who saved me.</i>

762
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:51,530
<i>-It means you're going to die.</i>
<i>-But the person who saved me...</i>
