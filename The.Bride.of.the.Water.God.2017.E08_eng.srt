1
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>You want to know how gods are created?</i>

2
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,581
As for humans, if you look at this,

3
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,833
you can see in detail what humans do
when they make love.

4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,504
Look. They do this and that.
They do all sorts of things.

5
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,838
After that...

6
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,967
Then a new human being gets created
in the woman's belly

7
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,344
and comes out into the world.

8
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,805
They call it "giving birth to a baby."

9
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,932
Then how do we gods get created?

10
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,642
I mean, we don't give birth.

11
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,270
Even when a god and a goddess
do all of these things here...

12
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,648
Lord Habaek.

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,775
Lord Habaek, please.

14
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,195
Gods just come into being.
No one gives birth to them.

15
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,198
-They just come into being?
-Yes. They exist on their own.

16
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,242
If I have to answer that question,

17
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,327
we could've been created
as the embodiment of humans' wishes.

18
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,331
It's also possible that we were created
by the universe's energy or by nature.

19
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,833
That's such a vague answer.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,545
That's the difference between humans
and us, the divine beings.

21
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,464
We deities like being vague and cryptic.

22
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,842
It is humans' job
to decipher our messages.

23
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,301
Humans ask...

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,431
why their world is the way it is
and continue seeking logical reasons.

25
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,810
That's how they come to terms
with their situations, but we're...

26
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,437
Deities are just deities.

27
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,733
Deities are divine beings that exist
above everything else.

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,443
We come into existence on our own?

29
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,413
Your high priest invited us,
saying he'd tell us an interesting story.

30
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,417
-What?
-That is why we can never become parents.

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,877
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,461
However,

33
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,839
there's a story about a god

34
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,383
who was born from a human body.

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,013
I heard that he possesses the nature
of both human beings and deities.

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,310
<i>He ages, gets ill, and dies</i>
<i>like his mother, who was a human,</i>

37
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,354
<i>but at the same time, he's immortal</i>
<i>like his father, who was a god.</i>

38
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,982
<i>I heard he's an eternal being</i>
<i>living an endlessly repeating life.</i>

39
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,776
How ugly and crude.

40
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,653
He can't be called a god.

41
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,948
If he exists, it'd be a shame
to our world. Does he really exist?

42
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,034
I heard he exists.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,369
I've never seen him, though.

44
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,044
Can someone like him be seen as a god?

45
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,381
Our appearances never change
from the moment we're created,

46
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,509
so we can't really think of him
as one of us.

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,429
However, he has powers like we do,

48
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,264
so we can't think of him as human either.

49
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,186
He sure is a being
that is not welcomed in either realm.

50
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,731
And unlike our abilities,

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,816
his powers aren't of a good nature.

52
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,610
They're not good?

53
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,321
The powers that we have...

54
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,283
are for giving the living force
to all things and looking after them,

55
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,953
but his powers destroy things.

56
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,915
He has the nature of fire.

57
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,958
-Fire?
-Fire?

58
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,670
Hence, I'm not sure how I feel about
letting him become one of us.

59
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,341
-He wouldn't be that fond of us either.
-Is he stronger than Habaek?

60
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,094
What? What kind of nonsense is that?

61
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,305
High Priest, is he stronger than Habaek?
He must be.

62
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,431
Biryeom is wrong, right?

63
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,768
-That I don't know.
-You don't know?

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,812
Habaek is stronger than him, of course.

65
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,859
I'm actually going to freeze
and crush your tongue.

66
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,701
There's no way he'd be stronger.

67
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,952
My Lord,

68
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,371
you were born as a king.

69
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,460
Half-human and half-god?

70
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,421
That's boring.

71
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:01,009
Humans even have a story about
a bear turning into a human being.

72
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,095
So he's stronger than Habaek?

73
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,222
The High Priest didn't say that.

74
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,016
He couldn't say anything
because it's true.

75
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,434
You are a disgrace to deities.

76
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,065
If he uses fire,
we should make him our blacksmith.

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,233
Don't be absurd.

78
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,529
If you ever run into him,
you better run away.

79
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,489
He'll definitely be stronger than you.

80
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,909
Habaek, you should ignore him
even if you meet him.

81
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,787
He has destructive powers?
He doesn't deserve to be a god.

82
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,000
<i>Is he bad?</i>

83
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,918
If he uses his power in a good way,
he'd be good.

84
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,545
If he uses it in a bad way, he'd be bad.

85
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,714
If he uses it in a weird way,
he'd be weird.

86
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,259
He could just be different too.

87
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,887
Why? Are you afraid?

88
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,183
Why would I be afraid of him?

89
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,684
We never die anyway.

90
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,270
-It doesn't make you immortal.
-Immortal?

91
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,065
As soon as we're forgotten by humans,

92
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,358
we're no longer deities.

93
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,777
Simply put,

94
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,364
we stop existing
even if we're still alive.

95
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,701
Many deities stop existing.

96
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,788
Just because humans forget about us,

97
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,790
we're not deities anymore?

98
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,586
He has such power?

99
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,712
Don't worry.

100
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:24,675
He's not a monster
with immeasurable power.

101
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,805
As he's not welcomed anywhere,
he must be hiding his identity.

102
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,723
But you'll recognize him right away.

103
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,227
It's because you'll be the king someday.

104
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,859
<i>I got you.</i>

105
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,408
You just got caught.

106
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,599
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

107
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,895
You get old like your mother,
who was a human being,

108
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,273
but you never die like your father,
who was a god.

109
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,738
This.

110
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,033
It's your blood, isn't it?

111
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,082
Hold on.

112
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,710
I can explain. Let's go.

113
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,878
Explain?

114
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,045
Did you know about him?

115
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,883
-Know what?
-This guy's identity!

116
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,427
What?

117
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,224
He is the CEO of--

118
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,184
Habaek.

119
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,524
I'm sorry, Mr. Shin.

120
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,486
He's not just antisocial,
he can sometimes be ridiculous too.

121
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,572
It's okay.

122
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,407
Excuse me.

123
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,747
Let's go.

124
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,000
Stay with Biryeom for the time being.

125
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,669
-What?
-Do it.

126
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,963
I have something to check.

127
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,444
CEO SHIN HU-YE

128
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,222
<i>You got caught.</i>

129
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,894
I said you got caught.

130
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,146
You get old just like your mother,
who was a human being,

131
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,148
but you never die like your father,
who was a god.

132
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,154
I know a person who can teleport,

133
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,366
a person who can make diamonds endlessly,

134
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,869
and a person who can master anything
just by seeing it once.

135
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,501
That person can transform as well.

136
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,219
-He's my friend.
-Our friendship is stronger

137
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,346
than anything in the world.

138
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,858
I'd like to apologize
for being prejudiced against you.

139
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,572
<i>Yun So-a.</i>

140
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,163
It seemed like he found out something.

141
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,040
I said you got...

142
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,208
caught.

143
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,544
He said he got caught.

144
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,713
But what was that about?

145
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,381
Did you know about him?

146
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,924
This guy's identity!

147
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,260
His identity?

148
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,847
What identity?

149
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,393
How can that be...

150
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,812
The High Priest was right.

151
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,399
-I recognized him right away.
-It's impossible.

152
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:51,984
No way.

153
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,030
Mr. Shin is half-human, half-god?

154
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,657
He's stronger than Lord Habaek?

155
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,162
He's supposed to live
in the world of deities.

156
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,290
-Why is he here?
-Why did you say that to him?

157
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,542
I told you to ignore him
even if you meet him.

158
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,835
You don't have your power.

159
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,421
What if he really is half-human, half-god?

160
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,840
What if he's planning something bad?

161
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,760
Have you lost your judgment
as well as your power?

162
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,762
I wanted him to reveal his identity.

163
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,516
He must...

164
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,646
have something to do
with Judong's disappearance.

165
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm sure of it.

166
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,736
You don't have any evidence.
It's just an assumption.

167
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,783
Evidence? You've been here so long,
you talk like humans.

168
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,118
I don't have powers like you.

169
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,453
As you two keep leaving me out,

170
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,206
I have to think like humans
to keep up with you.

171
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,419
We should make sure
he really is half-human, half-god.

172
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,463
Lord Habaek, you should stay out of it.

173
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,551
Why does he have to know So-a,
of all people?

174
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,137
What a strange coincidence.

175
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,809
I'll find out how they met each other.

176
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,811
Forget it.

177
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,230
Don't drag her into this.

178
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,523
Why?

179
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,816
You never know.

180
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,484
She's our servant.

181
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,070
I won't let him take ours.

182
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,406
What if she believes he is a god

183
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,367
and washes his socks or something?

184
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,995
She has her pride.

185
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,164
She wouldn't wash his socks.

186
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,125
You're so clueless.

187
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,836
She might have her pride,

188
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,630
but she's still just a human.

189
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,008
I'm not sure if you have
the right to say that.

190
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,430
The Land of the Sky taught Nak-bin
about human foolishness.

191
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,016
Do you think that gives you
the right to worry?

192
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,479
Although the Land of Water and
the world of deities forgave your king,

193
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,939
we didn't forgive what he had done.

194
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,215
Weren't you the one who got
a human being involved in this?

195
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,470
Like you said,
let's say So-a is a loyal divine servant

196
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,888
and doesn't fall for him.

197
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,473
But what about him?

198
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,601
Just like we suspect So-a
because she is with him,

199
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,438
wouldn't he become curious about her
because she is with you?

200
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,151
He might even think that
he deserves a servant.

201
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,989
I'm not sure.

202
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,078
As you said, I've been here so long,
I'm losing my touch.

203
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,747
You take care of it.

204
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,134
He sure is a god of trouble.

205
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,095
He keeps giving us more trouble.

206
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,723
I'm worried the half-human, half-god

207
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,726
will hurt Ms. Descendant out of spite.

208
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,106
DECLARATION OF INTENT
TO SELL REAL ESTATE

209
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,110
What's the big deal if he finds out?

210
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,737
I'm just selling my own land.

211
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,366
They'll criticize me...

212
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,911
for not being able to protect that land.

213
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,456
So what?

214
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,586
I have nothing to feel ashamed of.

215
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,432
<i>Hey, stop it. It's too loud.</i>

216
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,810
What? I'm just warning
the half-human, half-god.

217
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,525
Although the Land of Water and the
world of deities forgave your king,

218
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,987
we didn't forgive what he had done.

219
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,742
That jerk. He annoys me every time
I'm about to forget his obnoxiousness.

220
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,124
Half-human and half-god?

221
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,084
The fun part is over now.

222
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,688
Why did he show up here out of the blue?

223
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,235
Well,

224
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,697
I'm not trying to belittle you
or anything like that.

225
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,700
However, you're just her neighbor.

226
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,120
I don't think you can barge in here
out of the blue like this.

227
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,706
If you have something to say to her,
just do it in your neighborhood.

228
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,168
No, you can't see her whenever
you want even in your neighborhood.

229
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,879
Blessed Mental Health.

230
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,547
Nurse Yu Sang-yu.

231
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,548
Yes?

232
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,135
You're so chatty.

233
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,515
If you're rambling on like that

234
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,475
because I don't look rich,

235
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,269
you're making a big mistake.

236
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,480
Well...

237
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,858
Have we met before, by any chance?

238
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,569
Anyway,

239
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,448
you can't be so close with Dr. Yun.

240
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,826
She has a boyfriend.

241
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,954
She's letting you stay at her place
because she's tender-hearted.

242
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,748
I hope you see the reality
and know your place.

243
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,877
Her boyfriend is a very capable man.

244
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,172
He's the only one
who can stop her going to Vanuatu.

245
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,303
My gosh.

246
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,310
What are you doing here?

247
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,064
BERIWON RESORT

248
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,583
Have some.

249
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,512
Wait.

250
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,891
It's chipped.

251
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,143
You mean my tooth?

252
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,272
No.

253
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,442
This.

254
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,654
They say drinking from chipped mugs
can bring bad luck.

255
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,991
I'll drink this. I can't get
any unluckier than I am now.

256
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,953
What brings you here?

257
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,538
I wanted to go home with you.

258
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,626
What I meant by going home together was

259
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,337
going for a drive together
in my car that Mura gave me.

260
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,841
Nurse Yu is using the car today
because he wanted

261
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,636
to brag about the car to his friends
and take them for a ride.

262
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,262
That's his wish.

263
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
You can't even do it for him
when you're a god?

264
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,308
It's not like it requires your powers.

265
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,978
Do you have a thing called "boyfriend"?

266
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,106
Sorry?

267
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,150
Nurse Yu told me.

268
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,070
I looked it up on the internet

269
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,404
and found out that

270
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,907
it refers to the man with whom a woman
is in a romantic relationship.

271
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,120
And being in a romantic relationship means
that the two love each other.

272
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,037
Is that...

273
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,374
the kind of relationship
you have with the CEO of the resort?

274
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,127
What did you just say?

275
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,506
Gosh, no! Of course not.

276
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,636
When I fell asleep
for a few minutes the other day,

277
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,682
you apologized to me randomly.

278
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,395
I'm sorry too.

279
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,230
For what?

280
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,983
I'll take you to cool places,
get you good food,

281
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,068
and buy you nice clothes today.

282
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,404
Think of it as your early farewell party.

283
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,575
What are you doing?

284
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,785
I just want to feel at ease.

285
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,182
No!

286
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,365
That was so much fun.

287
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,704
Come on. Let's go.

288
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,248
You won't get used to it.
Why do you want to keep riding it?

289
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,835
I can do it. I can win this time.

290
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,713
You won. Mr. Nature,
you've already won. Enough!

291
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,381
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

292
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,804
A servant must not stop her master.
That is not a good attitude.

293
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,806
Being fixated on inconsequential things

294
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,600
isn't an attitude a king should have.

295
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,146
You're cute.

296
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,815
-What did you just say?
-You're pretty cute.

297
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,986
Well...

298
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,323
I think I'm a bit too old
to be told that I'm cute.

299
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,034
I'm 2,800 years old.

300
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,286
Right.

301
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,498
Let's go. I don't like this place.

302
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,334
For some reason,
this place makes me feel like a loser.

303
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,674
Why do you want to go to "Vanuatu"?

304
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,758
Sorry?

305
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,511
Oh, that's...

306
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,639
I'm wondering if being there
might make me feel better.

307
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,352
When a problem seems unsolvable,
no matter how hard you try,

308
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,312
you just want to let it all go.

309
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,107
Is it because of the thing called "money"?
Because you need it?

310
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,609
That's one of the reasons.

311
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,946
It's also because of my dad.

312
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,533
Then grant me a wish.

313
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,994
Let me meet my dad.

314
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,706
I want to ask him why he had to dump
all of these burdens on me

315
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,793
and if he's been able to sleep at night
and eat since leaving like that.

316
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,420
I want to tell him
to take them all from me.

317
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,463
He couldn't even save his own daughter.

318
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,425
How is he going to save the world?
If I could ask him that question...

319
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,803
I'd have nothing more to wish for.

320
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,975
I want to start my life afresh.

321
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,852
I also don't like living in this country.

322
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,731
I've grown to like here a bit
compared to when I first arrived,

323
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,108
especially because of things
like cars and cell phones.

324
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,444
So what? You'll leave soon anyway.

325
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,575
What did you and Mr. Shin
talk about earlier?

326
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,537
<i>Gosh, why did I bring that up?</i>

327
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,247
Why do you ask? You want to know?

328
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,250
Why did you say that he got caught?

329
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,627
I told him to stay away from my woman.

330
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,923
-I beg your pardon?
-I told him that you're mine

331
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,885
and that I know he's trying to hit on you.
I also said that he needs...

332
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,804
my permission to make a move.

333
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,811
What's he saying?

334
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,481
What was that about?

335
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,529
<i>I just...</i>

336
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,452
made a common mistake<i> </i>that everyone makes.

337
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,791
I relied on someone without realizing it.

338
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,168
I started to have expectations.

339
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,216
Most of all, I revealed my feelings,
which was the worst of it all.

340
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,553
You probably thought you could do that
with that person.

341
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,763
No.

342
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,642
I shouldn't have.

343
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,397
He's going to leave anyway.

344
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,442
To be precise, he's not a person.

345
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,239
Was that it?

346
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,272
<i>Exactly.</i>

347
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,066
<i>You're from a much greater world.</i>

348
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,652
<i>You should do greater things.</i>

349
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,739
<i>Non-consequential little things...</i>

350
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,201
<i>can fade</i>
<i>like a sound traveling far away...</i>

351
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,248
<i>but it wouldn't matter.</i>

352
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,512
<i>Hello?</i>

353
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,181
Let's go home together tonight.

354
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,223
Sorry?

355
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,475
<i>Let's go home together.</i>

356
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,313
WATER DEMON

357
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,693
I just left home.
What is he talking about?

358
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,946
Who is this?

359
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,033
You saw her on TV the other day
and said she was pretty.

360
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,243
She wasn't popular at first.

361
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,996
After taking these photos,

362
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,040
she became a star right away.

363
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,376
I'll become famous,

364
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,254
and you'll travel abroad for free.

365
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,964
It'd be great.

366
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,049
Oh, my!

367
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,717
What?

368
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,011
Don't you dare do anything like that.

369
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,013
I won't leave any money to you.

370
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,848
Quit your job right away.

371
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,393
Work at Mr. Shin's
Block World Shopping Mall.

372
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,811
Mr. Shin?

373
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,147
Is he buying your land?

374
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,608
He has no one to rely on,

375
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,444
but he can take care of himself.

376
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,322
Who can I trust?

377
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,950
My goodness!

378
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,992
I'll do it.

379
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,577
I can do it well.

380
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,790
Really? Are you going to work
at the shopping mall?

381
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,000
I'll think about it.

382
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,504
Anyway, I'll take over
your business someday.

383
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,422
It wouldn't hurt to get some experience.

384
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,092
I'll take care of it.

385
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,843
You can trust me.

386
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,648
Mr. Shin.

387
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,943
Mr. Shin?

388
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,655
Yes.

389
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,283
I canceled your schedule
for the afternoon, like you said,

390
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,077
but you'll still have to visit
the Songdo site

391
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,829
and meet the guests from Laos.

392
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,415
I see.

393
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,041
Is something wrong?

394
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,962
No. I'll see you there.

395
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,131
Nice.

396
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,843
Hey.

397
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,303
What's with him?

398
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,598
Hey, didn't you hear me?
I have something to tell you.

399
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,558
It's about the site for Block World.

400
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,935
What's with you?

401
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,483
I'm busy. Talk to Mr. Min.

402
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,783
Hey.

403
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,202
Hey!

404
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,960
-Mr. Min--
-Fine, Mr. Min.

405
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,837
-What is with Mr. Shin?
-What do you mean?

406
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,297
Why is he so cold...

407
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,299
I mean, why is he so busy?

408
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,467
He's always busy.

409
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,803
But he has never done this before.

410
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,555
He can be like that sometimes.

411
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,265
No, he's never been like that.

412
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,433
What do you mean?

413
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,685
Well, he's never been...

414
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,688
-So cold?
-Exactly. He's never been so cold.

415
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,232
You always said he was stuck-up.

416
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,944
What's your business here?

417
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,489
-I'm a bit busy too.
-Well...

418
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,201
It's about the site for Block World.

419
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,286
I'm in charge now. Talk to me from now on.

420
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,082
There's nothing to talk about.
We just need to sign the contract.

421
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,335
We just signed an important contract.

422
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,961
We'll send you a contract soon.

423
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,172
Okay.

424
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,176
I want to talk to Mr. Shin directly.

425
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,095
Also, I'm shooting in the morning
from tomorrow.

426
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,347
I'll stay here for a few days.
Get a room ready.

427
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,810
By the way, what is with Mr. Shin?

428
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,979
What is with him? Hey!

429
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,107
I'm not doing this because I like him.

430
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,652
I just feel a bit hurt. That's why.

431
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,612
You're doing this because you like him.

432
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,781
I've known it for a while.

433
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,741
What?

434
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,077
I've seen many girls like you
at my church.

435
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,829
What are you talking about?

436
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:30,166
After the service, they would
come to me and ask for advice.

437
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,668
Most of them are high school girls.

438
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,422
They bother the boys they have a crush on
to make their feelings known,

439
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,507
just like kids do.

440
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,142
BERIWON RESORT

441
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,400
DECLARATION OF INTENT
TO SELL REAL ESTATE

442
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:06,035
Would this mail know
that we're closing down soon?

443
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,333
Mr. Ma's father is a bank manager.

444
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,462
I talked to him about taking out a loan,
and he said we could come to him

445
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,006
-with the documents.
-We don't need it anymore.

446
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,718
Wait. Did you go to an amusement park?

447
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,762
With who?

448
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,806
-Who did you go there with?
-Get out.

449
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,018
Come on. It's my wallet.

450
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,024
I hope it's not that neighbor.

451
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,153
Who are you to say that?

452
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,909
ENJOYMENT LAND

453
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,536
<i>I told him to stay away from my woman.</i>

454
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,123
<i>I told him that you're mine</i>
<i>and that I know he's trying to hit on you.</i>

455
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,210
<i>I also said that he needs</i>
<i>my permission to make a move.</i>

456
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,588
A neighbor...

457
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,800
What happened to your face?
Do you have a fever?

458
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,969
Just a second. Let me get some fresh air.

459
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,346
Are you getting sick?

460
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,182
Don't follow me. You're so--

461
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,308
Oh, my.

462
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,895
I need your help.

463
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,781
Sleep disorders can have
many different causes.

464
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,951
Physical pain or discomfort--

465
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,828
I keep thinking about the past.

466
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,164
Do you remember...
what I said the other day?

467
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,501
I had forgotten about it,

468
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,088
but something that happened recently
brought back the memories.

469
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,635
I haven't told anyone about it,

470
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,763
so it feels a bit awkward.

471
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,187
I'm a psychiatrist.
You can tell me anything.

472
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,571
I don't know who my mother is.

473
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,491
My father...

474
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,081
My father...

475
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,501
treated me like a monster.

476
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,381
I wasn't supposed to be born.

477
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,465
"Disgrace."

478
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,470
That was my name.

479
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,809
My father was afraid
people would find out about me.

480
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,312
He locked me up for a long time.

481
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,275
On a winter night,

482
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,277
he...

483
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,367
kicked me out.

484
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,336
<i>Clouds were covering</i>
<i>all the stars and the moon.</i>

485
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,504
<i>I wasn't scared of darkness.</i>

486
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,798
<i>I was used to it.</i>

487
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,844
<i>What scared me was...</i>

488
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,305
<i>that unfamiliar air.</i>

489
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,687
<i>I encountered the world</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

490
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:25,526
<i>It smelled and felt completely different</i>
<i>from the place I had been imprisoned.</i>

491
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,784
<i>I still don't know...</i>

492
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,454
where that place was.

493
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,373
I don't even want to know.

494
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,964
<i>I was so scared, I just wanted to run away</i>
<i>from the place.</i>

495
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,802
<i>Just then,</i>
<i>a light flashed in the distance.</i>

496
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,931
<i>After a moment, it flashed again.</i>

497
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,600
<i>I ran towards the light.</i>

498
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,907
<i>She's feeling sympathy.</i>

499
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,994
<i>She's not showing</i>
<i>any contempt, hostility, or fear.</i>

500
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,746
<i>She's definitely not one of them.</i>

501
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,126
<i>If she knew who I am, she wouldn't</i>
<i>be showing that kind of emotion.</i>

502
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,586
<i>She's not one of them.</i>

503
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,547
<i>Then who is she?</i>

504
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,508
<i>How does she know who they are?</i>

505
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,261
Well...

506
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,513
Mr. Shin...

507
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,560
My story has a happy ending.

508
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,314
That night, I could've ended up
becoming a beast.

509
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,152
However, someone saved me.

510
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,239
Thanks to that person,
I was able to become a human,

511
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,951
and that's why I can live
as a decent human being now.

512
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,996
Someone saved you?

513
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,248
Yes. He adopted me.

514
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,084
That's how I got my surname, Shin.

515
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,962
I see.

516
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,758
That's what happened.

517
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,386
You should try to sleep
without the help of sleep aids.

518
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,723
Try doing other things so that
you can stop the chain of thoughts.

519
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,100
If you continue
to have difficulty sleeping,

520
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,186
come see me again for another session.

521
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,066
Thank you.

522
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,864
Mr. Shin.

523
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,452
The other day,

524
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,580
you said that you want
to become a good person.

525
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,709
Someone who helps others
and contributes to society.

526
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,253
You said you want to become
a useful person.

527
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,717
Now, I can understand...

528
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,637
why you said that.

529
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,264
That day,

530
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,185
I belittled your sincerity.

531
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,854
I'm sorry.

532
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,028
I think you have been living your life
like that,

533
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,990
and I trust that you will continue
to maintain that way of life.

534
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,495
Your trees...

535
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,997
will form a big forest.

536
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,127
Goodbye.

537
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,271
However, someone saved me.

538
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,649
Thanks to that person,
I could become human,

539
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,653
and that's why I can live
as a decent human being now.

540
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,072
Someone saved you?

541
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,909
What am I thinking?

542
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,799
Hey, Jingeon.

543
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,428
He can talk?

544
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,973
All right. Keep tailing him.

545
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,186
You froze and crushed his tongue.

546
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,270
How can he talk?

547
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,648
All you do is boss around
those lowly deities.

548
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,442
This is why Habaek doesn't like you.

549
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,986
There are millions of reasons
why he doesn't like me.

550
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,699
-Where are we going?
-If I want him to hate me less,

551
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,202
I should show him
how loyal I can be, don't you think?

552
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,094
<i>I belittled your sincerity. I'm sorry.</i>

553
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,180
Your trees...

554
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,849
will form a big forest.

555
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,911
-Hello?
-<i>Sir.</i>

556
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,539
<i>The guests from Laos</i>
<i>will arrive in 20 minutes.</i>

557
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,168
All right. I'm almost there.
I'll see you shortly.

558
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,388
What are you trying to do?

559
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,391
Shouldn't we see whether or not
what Habaek said is true?

560
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,060
It'd be best for his sake as well.

561
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,813
I don't think we should do this.

562
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,147
Why not?

563
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,858
What will you do if Mr. Shin
isn't half-human and half-god?

564
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,070
-What if he's just human?
-Then that'd be his fate.

565
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,614
-What?
-Do you not believe Habaek?

566
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,449
That's not what I'm saying.

567
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,330
Stop it, Biryeom.

568
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,171
This is wrong, Biryeom.

569
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,675
You said you'd believe anything
Habaek says. Why are you being like this?

570
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,522
Stop it, Biryeom!

571
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,111
-I said stop!
-Bring it on, you monster.

572
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,904
Reveal who you really are.

573
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,240
Biryeom!

574
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,673
Mura.

575
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,301
You're hopeless!

576
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,566
You said that he's a good guy.

577
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,862
Do you have feelings for him or what?
You're not acting like yourself.

578
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,285
Or is it something...

579
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,454
more than just feelings?

580
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,122
I did it because of you, idiot.

581
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,209
What if Habaek is wrong?

582
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,503
What will you do
if Mr. Shin is a human being?

583
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,507
You know that we're not allowed
to harm humans in any way.

584
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,926
If you break that rule,
you can't return to the divine world.

585
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,470
Why on earth are you being like this?

586
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,932
Why are you doing whatever you want?
Why are you acting up like this?

587
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,315
Habaek.

588
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,320
<i>You should be even more careful now.</i>
<i>It must've provoked him.</i>

589
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,574
What's wrong with you two?
Why are you guys acting so rash?

590
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,951
All right.

591
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,253
Biryeom, arrange a meeting with him.

592
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,923
He wants to go home with me.

593
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,385
He wants to go home with me.
He wants to...

594
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,555
Does that mean...

595
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,182
he'd come here to pick me up?

596
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,520
Gosh! He'd never do that.

597
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,733
Yesterday, he said that it meant
he wanted to go for a drive.

598
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,487
Then was he saying he wants
to go for a drive with me today?

599
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,617
My gosh, what on earth am I thinking now?

600
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,495
What's happening?

601
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,206
How much longer do I have to wait?
I'm dying to know.

602
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,335
-Yeom-mi, it's--
-Who's that guy, Jude Law?

603
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,004
Why can't I do a reading on him?

604
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,011
Don't look at me like that.
I was even more flabbergasted.

605
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,138
And you should give up fortune telling.

606
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,224
You couldn't even recognize deities.
You're obviously not clairvoyant.

607
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,934
Are you sick or something?

608
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,562
You've been asking me
the same question for an hour now.

609
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,607
Just accept it, please.
Who else will believe it if you don't?

610
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,942
There's nothing I can do
if you choose not to believe it.

611
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,820
Then let me meet him just once more.

612
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,030
Habaek?

613
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,656
No, that guy.

614
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,800
You look so healthy.

615
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,678
Let's be friends. It's nice to meet you.

616
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:15,783
WHITE LOTUS HOUSE

617
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,371
I thought it would be enough
to make you act first,

618
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,373
but I didn't hear anything from you.

619
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,626
-I'm right about you, aren't I?
-You recognized me.

620
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,462
It means you're either the ruler
or the soon-to-be ruler.

621
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,548
Now that you know that,
you should pay respects.

622
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,174
I don't belong to that world.

623
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,010
Why should I?

624
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,305
Are you saying you're human?

625
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,393
I don't care what those in your world
think about me.

626
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,437
I don't want to fight with you
and those in your realm.

627
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,188
You guys and I have...

628
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,402
-nothing to do with each other.
-We don't care either.

629
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,529
However,

630
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,656
there's something I need to check.

631
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,200
If what I'm thinking is right,

632
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,413
you'll be proving that you are indeed
the legendary monster.

633
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,248
What are you talking about?

634
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,052
This is the sign of Judong.
Why is it marked on your body?

635
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,764
-Let go of me.
-Where's Judong?

636
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,308
-I don't know who he is!
-Then explain this.

637
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,727
I have no reason to explain anything
about my body to you.

638
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,103
You have no reason?

639
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,231
This is the sign of Judong
and the symbol of the Land of Earth.

640
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,441
Then does that mean the god

641
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,235
who broke the order of our world
and gave you life is...

642
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,487
the god of the Land of Earth?

643
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,659
Even so, you still cannot have
this sign on your body.

644
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,702
I guess they did not warn you...

645
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,663
about my powers.

646
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,955
You must not be sure...

647
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,709
whether or not that power of yours
will work on me.

648
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:35,923
Habaek!

649
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,599
-What are you doing?
-Be quiet.

650
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,852
-Leave.
-What are you...

651
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,521
Do you want to be humiliated?

652
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,819
Mister.

653
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,492
Is someone here?

654
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,541
No.

655
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,733
-He has Judong's sign.
-We'll take care of it.

656
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,360
-I'll--
-Habaek, please!

657
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,447
You don't need to prove it.

658
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,906
You're already our king.

659
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,825
You've been our king for 2,800 years.

660
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,036
I'm sorry about what happened
to the sacred stones.

661
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,372
We'll take care of it,
so please be patient and wait.

662
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,352
Why isn't he calling?

663
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,855
He came early yesterday.

664
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,357
I wonder if he's waiting
until I get off work.

665
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,029
My gosh, it's not like I'm expecting him.

666
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,866
You're going to go home now, right?

667
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,659
What's your problem?

668
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,453
I'll close the clinic myself.

669
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,996
And it's too early to go home.

670
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,080
What?

671
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,624
Don't you care about work anymore?

672
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,584
I want you to strictly keep
to our working hours

673
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,503
until I leave for Vanuatu.
Do you understand?

674
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,505
It's the anniversary of
your mother's death today.

675
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,007
Don't tell me you forgot.

676
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,468
Does that mean you didn't order food
for the memorial service?

677
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,603
I must be crazy.

678
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,898
What is wrong with me?

679
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,052
My gosh!

680
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,867
<i>Mom.</i>

681
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,369
<i>Mom.</i>

682
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,961
You never ate,

683
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,549
and you always drank.
Look what happened to you now.

684
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,388
I'm sure they don't even have alcohol
up there.

685
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,474
What are you going to eat there?

686
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,023
You should've at least eaten well
while you were alive.

687
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,067
What's wrong?

688
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,279
Nothing's going right...

689
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,492
because of you.

690
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,209
No.

691
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,173
It's all my fault.

692
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,441
Be careful.

693
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,610
My mom sometimes tries to come out.

694
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,297
HAESARI

695
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,441
Mom.

696
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,904
I was possessed by a water demon,
so I forgot to prepare your food.

697
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,199
I came to tell you
that you don't need to come.

698
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:43,290
I hope you already feel full just
by seeing your daughter's face.

699
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:11,026
My dad abandoned me and my mother.

700
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:17,574
My mom was so angry,
so she always drank alcohol.

701
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,161
Then she passed away due to liver cancer.

702
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,584
I really hate my dad,

703
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,669
but I also hate my mom as well.

704
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,173
I think both my parents

705
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,759
were selfish people
who only cared about themselves.

706
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,184
During the 2,800 years
that you've been alive,

707
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,105
have you ever felt embarrassed
or regretted anything?

708
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,272
No.

709
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,528
I have a lot of regrets,

710
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,448
and I've felt embarrassed just once.

711
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,409
I was so embarrassed that day,

712
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,538
so I don't think I'll easily
be embarrassed by anything else.

713
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,042
After my mom died,

714
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,004
all my hatred was directed towards my dad,

715
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,507
and my life was a complete mess.

716
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,927
So, one day,

717
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,722
I wanted to take revenge on my dad.

718
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:28,061
I jumped into the river in midwinter.

719
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,150
Gosh, it's funny.

720
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,278
It was so cold...

721
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,948
that I couldn't wait until I died.

722
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,994
I really wanted to get out of there

723
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,413
because I felt like I was going
to freeze to death.

724
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,791
I took swimming lessons only
for a short time when I was little.

725
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,960
But I suddenly started using
what I learned to the fullest.

726
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,130
So I ended up staying alive.

727
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,799
But after that day,

728
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,220
I could never bring myself to swim
ever again.

729
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,100
This is embarrassing.

730
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,728
I'm so embarrassed.

731
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,573
I'm glad it's dark.

732
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,868
You better be grateful
that I lost my powers.

733
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,247
If I still had my powers,
this place wouldn't be so dark.

734
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,333
What?

735
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,295
Does that mean
you would've put up streetlights?

736
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,256
How silly.

737
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,011
Like this.

738
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,349
Like this?

739
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,061
Yes. If I do this,

740
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,897
the world's brightest water fireflies
will show up.

741
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,566
Water fireflies?

742
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,656
Can you see them?

743
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,370
No, I can't see anything.

744
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,248
Look carefully...

745
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,124
with your heart.

746
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,618
I almost forgot.

747
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,747
What did you mean when you said
"Let's go home together"?

748
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,460
I was on my way to work.
What did you mean when you said...

749
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,962
I meant I'd come pick you up.

750
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,381
What?

751
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,343
Why all of a sudden?

752
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,513
I have my reasons. I went to your clinic,
but you had already gone home.

753
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,640
Go on inside.

754
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,621
Hey, by the way,

755
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,584
how about we come home together tomorrow
since we didn't get to do it today?

756
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,506
Do you want to do the things
that we didn't get to do yesterday?

757
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,676
-"The things we didn't get to do"?
-Yes, I mean...

758
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,137
I said I'd feed you good food

759
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,472
and take you to a great place.

760
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,188
If you insist.

761
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:25,942
Okay.

762
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,862
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

763
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,876
BERIWON RESORT

764
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,507
BERIWON RESORT

765
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,772
You're leaving early today.

766
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,609
Yes, I'm expecting
a group of customers today.

767
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,989
Hey, I have a question to ask
about that land.

768
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,533
Even if I sell that land,

769
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,703
Mr. Nature still won't have a problem
with becoming the king, right?

770
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,332
Yes, pretty much.

771
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,000
Then it's all good.

772
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,503
But...

773
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:32,550
"But even in our world,
there are those who seek opportunity."

774
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,968
What does that mean?

775
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,514
-Did Lord Habaek say that?
-Yes.

776
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,474
Well, the thing is,

777
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,393
there were a few attempts...

778
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,980
to take Lord Habaek's place
a long time ago.

779
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,776
But I thought that kind of thing
never happened in your world.

780
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,944
Normally, yes.

781
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,821
But the king of the Land of the Sky
got too greedy.

782
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,532
He did something...

783
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,409
that he should never have done
to Lord Habaek.

784
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,163
-"Something he should never have done"?
-No, it's nothing.

785
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,548
DECLARATION OF INTENT
TO SELL REAL ESTATE

786
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,994
Are you going somewhere?

787
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,705
We don't have any patients today, do we?

788
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,125
They must think that our clinic's
going to shut down or something.

789
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,459
I haven't received a single call.

790
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,128
Let's do our best.

791
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,339
Let's hand out our business cards
and frequently update our blog.

792
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,800
I heard there's a firm
that advertises hospitals.

793
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:56,718
Look into that firm.

794
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,803
And be nice to our patients.

795
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,015
We have no other choice.

796
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,309
Let's work day and night.

797
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:09,147
And call Mr. Ma's father again.

798
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,234
Did you get another call from
the Korean Leopard Preservation Council?

799
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,277
No.

800
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,323
It actually turns out to be of no use.

801
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,009
BERIWON RESORT

802
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,929
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

803
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,097
Ms. Yun...

804
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,935
I know that this is complete nonsense.

805
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,358
I'll figure out a way
to pay for the cancellation fee.

806
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,402
What's your reason?

807
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,114
Why are you suddenly overdoing things?

808
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,949
I thought you needed money.

809
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,163
Well...

810
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,253
It's because of leopards' poop.

811
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,630
Pardon?

812
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:22,136
Well, some people found
Korean leopards' poop on my land.

813
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,098
Apparently,
the Korean Leopard Preservation Council

814
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,392
have been working with Russia
for a long time

815
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,019
to resurrect Korean leopards.

816
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:35,316
Of all the land out there,
they must've pooped on my land

817
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,984
around 100 years ago.

818
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,321
So as a Korean citizen,

819
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,282
I felt like the resurrection of
Korean leopards was urgent.

820
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,784
Ms. Yun.

821
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,830
I'll try talking about this...

822
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,083
during the meeting.

823
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,800
What in the world have I done?

824
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,762
I'm acting as if I got possessed
or something.

825
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,683
I actually am possessed by a water demon.

826
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,938
WATER DEMON

827
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,398
Hello?

828
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,649
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

829
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,694
I'll see you there.
Are you sure you know the way?

830
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:20,695
<i>Of course.</i>

831
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,204
That Water Demon.

832
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:50,057
I'll help you with it.

833
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,309
Thank you.

834
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,269
Where are you going?

835
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,522
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

836
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,321
Excuse me.
How can I get to the other side?

837
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:07,950
-Go straight this way and go up.
-Right.

838
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,035
Thank you.

839
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,957
Am I too early?

840
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,968
You'll have to wait a bit longer.

841
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,680
It looks like I have some
unfinished business to take care of here.

842
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:08,886
What's with him?

843
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,554
<i>It looks like you're pretending</i>
<i>to be a good person.</i>

844
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:54,682
<i>-What is it that you want?</i>
-<i>I don't know why you're hesitating,</i>

845
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,392
<i>but I won't just spectate this time.</i>

846
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,853
<i>So you're going back now?</i>

847
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,187
<i>I have to leave.</i>

848
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,523
<i>So what can you do to me?</i>
<i>Do you plan to kill me or what?</i>

849
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,900
<i>You're a really bad god.</i>

850
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,611
<i>Can you do a better job</i>
<i>in doing that than I can?</i>

851
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,405
<i>-Did you kill him?</i>
<i>-What I'm interested in right now is...</i>

852
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,532
<i>Go and see what your woman is up to now.</i>

853
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:12,992
<i>-It's Yun So-a.</i>
<i>-What do you mean?</i>

854
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,913
<i>Mr. Shin.</i>
