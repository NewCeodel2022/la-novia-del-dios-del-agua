1
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,853
2 HOURS AGO

2
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,585
That thing.

3
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,337
Get me one too.

4
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,713
What's he saying?

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,007
Come on. Let's go.

6
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,177
Why do I have to do this?

7
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,473
Why is he taking everything out on me?

8
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,185
He's been going on about that goddess.
Why doesn't he ask her to save him?

9
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,020
Why only bother me?
He must think I'm easy.

10
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,607
He sees me as a pushover.
That's what servants are.

11
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,707
Hurry up and lead the way.

12
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,628
Sure. I am leading the way.

13
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,536
I knew that would happen.

14
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,455
He's trying to make the brake
cause an accident.

15
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,591
<i>The tires will malfunction because</i>
<i>the brake oil is diluted with water.</i>

16
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,885
<i>As the unscrewed valve</i>
<i>becomes looser with time,</i>

17
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,511
<i>the brake will stop working.</i>

18
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,181
<i>The loosened brake linings</i>
<i>will affect the back wheels too,</i>

19
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,599
<i>and the car will drift to one side.</i>

20
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,769
<i>This drift will make</i>
<i>the speed go up like crazy.</i>

21
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
Hey, woman.

22
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,816
This is when you need to call the police.

23
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,728
For what?

24
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,528
-What are you sorry for?
-Did you have a dream?

25
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,322
I'm thirsty. Give me some water.

26
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,746
In addition to getting hungry,
do you get thirsty too?

27
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,956
What else?

28
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,751
If you run fast,
do you become out of breath?

29
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,628
If you walk a long distance,
do your legs and back ache?

30
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,671
How did you know?

31
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,757
When I started to become hungry,
everything else started too.

32
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,511
It's just between you and me.

33
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,265
I wish I could talk to someone about this.

34
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,979
It's refreshing.

35
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,023
It reminds me of the Land of Water.
Is it fruit juice?

36
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,526
I think I'll ask Mura and Biryeom

37
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,236
to take good care of these trees.

38
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,198
Namsuri.

39
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,700
Namsuri.

40
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,952
Let's go.

41
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,207
I definitely heard it.

42
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,710
Didn't I?

43
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,962
I think I did.

44
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,592
Give me the keys.

45
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,220
Why?

46
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,059
What are you doing?
You can't drive without a license.

47
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,644
That is humans' law.

48
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,604
I'm a god. Get in.

49
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,692
-I mean--
-Just get in.

50
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,193
Will you slow down?

51
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,445
If you don't have a license,
at least observe the rules.

52
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,530
The speed limit is 70km per hour.

53
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,449
I don't know what you're talking about.

54
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,383
Watch out. What should we do?

55
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,321
If you want to die, go die alone.

56
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,864
Right, you're a god.

57
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,991
You'll never die,
so you don't have to be careful.

58
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,077
I'm so jealous you can live forever.

59
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,746
-You're so noisy.
-I'm jealous you can do anything.

60
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,164
You're a king too. Great.

61
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,917
But I'm mortal because I'm a human being.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,586
Even if I don't die, I don't enjoy speed.

63
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,004
Fine, will you be quiet?

64
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,589
I'll be generous and slow down.

65
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,347
Why are you not slowing down?
Do you want me to go on?

66
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,348
Hang on.

67
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,560
-I knew it.
-Gosh.

68
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,728
You probably don't know
because you're a god.

69
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,939
-Accidents can result in trauma--
-I can't.

70
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,858
Just slow down.

71
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,611
-The brakes don't work.
-What?

72
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,031
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,788
Stop joking around. It's not funny.

74
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,665
What's going on?

75
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,213
They really don't work?

76
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:07,987
NO ENTRY

77
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,075
The tunnel is under construction.

78
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,869
It's blocked. We can't go in.

79
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,664
-Lord Habaek.
-No.

80
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,750
I don't want to die like this.

81
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,084
<i>Give me a second.</i>

82
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,212
<i>I won't let my servant die so easily.</i>

83
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>Stop.</i>

84
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,342
-Lord Habaek.
-<i>Stop.</i>

85
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,388
Please let me live.

86
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,933
Do something.

87
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,021
-<i>Stop.</i>
-Please.

88
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,773
<i>Stop!</i>

89
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,662
Lord Habaek.

90
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,708
Lord Habaek.

91
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,800
What are you doing?

92
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,516
-Hold onto the wheel.
-Sorry?

93
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,311
I'll go up first. Follow me.

94
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,063
What are you going to do?

95
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,906
Come on.

96
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,994
I can't. I can't do this.

97
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,831
Trust me.

98
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,447
What are you going to do?

99
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
We're going to jump off.

100
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,285
Namsuri, get out of the car on your own.

101
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,873
No. I can't.

102
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,425
Don't be scared. You're a god's servant.

103
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,485
Are you okay?

104
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,951
What just happened?

105
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,473
It's okay.

106
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,985
Lord Habaek!

107
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,993
Your power is back.

108
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,538
It's finally back.

109
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,969
I hope it won't go away again.

110
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,721
Try it.

111
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,435
Forget it.

112
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,312
It's already disappeared.

113
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,981
I don't even have to try.

114
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,150
Are you sure?

115
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,697
Why is this happening?

116
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,407
Why?

117
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,749
My power will be back again soon.
I can feel it.

118
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,210
Don't worry. I'll go report now.

119
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,170
Report? What do you mean?

120
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,383
Somebody messed around with the brakes.

121
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,177
I've seen it in many movies.

122
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,513
Look--

123
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,807
Like you said,
surveillance cameras are everywhere.

124
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,768
You said they see more
than what gods can see.

125
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,734
Why would that man do such a thing?

126
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,529
I was going to ask for directions,
and you treat me like a pervert.

127
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,657
He confessed that he messed
around with your brakes.

128
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,369
You parked where the car
could be seen clearly on cameras,

129
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,247
so everything was caught on the footage.
You know him, right?

130
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,414
Yes.

131
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,752
Well, not really.
A few days ago, I ran into him--

132
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,838
Weren't you in a rear-end collision
three months ago?

133
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,798
Isn't he that guy? Park Sang-cheol.

134
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,299
Pardon me?

135
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,263
My gosh!

136
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,642
What was that about?

137
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,652
Gosh, seriously.

138
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,949
Excuse me.

139
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,578
What is wrong with this person?

140
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,329
Excuse me!

141
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,216
Is he the driver from that time?

142
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,052
Yes. Did the two of you have any problems
while sorting things out

143
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,470
after the accident?

144
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,266
No, the insurance company
took care of everything.

145
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,102
I haven't even seen him since that day.

146
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,522
The driver who bumped your car
last month, Park Sang-cheol.

147
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
He called again.

148
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,943
Also, Park Sang-cheol called again.
He said he'll call again.

149
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,071
<i>Mr. Park Sang-cheol called, saying</i>
<i>it'll be the last time for real.</i>

150
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,114
<i>He sounded resolute.</i>

151
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,130
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

152
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,798
He's a complete psycho.

153
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,802
He's saying that accident
left a stain on his life.

154
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,721
-What?
-He had been living proudly,

155
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,056
thinking that his life was perfect,

156
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,142
but he had to pay a fine
and get demerit points because of it,

157
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,102
which made all of his hard work
go to waste.

158
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,604
He keeps saying it's so unfair.

159
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,065
He said that he did it
because everything was Ms. Yun's fault.

160
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,068
What did you just say? It's not like
it gave him a criminal record.

161
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,445
How can he bear such a grudge
because of demerit points?

162
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,488
That makes no sense.

163
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,073
Plus, he's the one who bumped her car.

164
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,491
He's just crazy.

165
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,369
He also said that he tried to push her off
a high-rise building

166
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,664
a few days ago, but she didn't die.
He keeps saying that she's not human.

167
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,626
He's saying it can't be considered
attempted murder because of it.

168
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,920
He keeps insisting that
it was an act of exorcism.

169
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,921
There's more.

170
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,800
He said that gentleman over there
isn't human either.

171
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,135
You two are humans, right?

172
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,395
The culprit has been caught,

173
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,605
and you now know the reason too.
It's all over now.

174
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,566
You can focus on serving me from now on.

175
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,074
I saved your life twice.
Shouldn't you show more gratitude?

176
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,661
Pardon?

177
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,425
I guess I can put up a partition wall.

178
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,261
Lord Habaek loves taking warm baths.

179
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,390
<i>He used to stay in the water all day long.</i>

180
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,268
<i>He used to have</i>
<i>an amazingly comfortable life.</i>

181
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,899
Men must never be content so easily.

182
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,529
I did some research
since I can read the human alphabet now,

183
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,698
and I learned that there's
a thing called bubble bath.

184
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,991
Sorry?

185
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,410
I want a rose-scented one.
Get me a new phone too.

186
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,329
It got smashed while I was saving you.

187
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,540
And I want more new clothes.

188
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,834
Also, I want better food.

189
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,503
About 12 side dishes per meal
would be good.

190
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,269
I can't afford to buy meat
even for myself.

191
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,608
He did save my life, though.

192
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:48,984
15,200 WON

193
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,070
Let me see.

194
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,454
EXPIRING SOON, 50 PERCENT OFF
7,600 WON

195
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,501
I was so scared,
thinking that she might find out.

196
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,171
When you first told me, I wasn't sure
whether I should believe you.

197
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,675
Someone messed with the brakes? Why?

198
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,220
It must be the jerk who tried to kill her.

199
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,347
Then we should tell her. Ms. Descendant!

200
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,102
Don't. I think my power comes back
when she begs me

201
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,895
to save her life.

202
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,482
It's a great opportunity.

203
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,400
<i>It did come back, but it was pointless.</i>

204
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,527
<i>It's gone again.</i>

205
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,488
What would you have done
if you hadn't regained your power?

206
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,908
We would've met Ms. Descendant
in the underworld.

207
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,286
I saved her life.

208
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,665
But still, how can you expose a woman
to such a dangerous situation?

209
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,250
The outcome is what matters.

210
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,503
And I did apologize to her in advance.

211
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,546
You apologized?

212
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,510
I have to mix the soaked glass noodles
with vegetables.

213
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,430
<i>I should let it cool down first.</i>

214
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,809
<i>Right, fritters. I should fry them now.</i>

215
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,397
I think everything is going well.

216
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,898
Wash the squid.

217
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,780
They look so crispy and delicious.

218
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,327
The aroma of freshly cooked rice.

219
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,579
It'll be so delicious.

220
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,834
I think I'm a pretty good cook.

221
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,752
Wonderful.

222
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,212
Gosh, the squid!

223
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,714
INSTANT NOODLES

224
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:40,095
Since humans aren't omnipotent,
there are things that they can't do.

225
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,641
I don't think humans are capable of
making 12 side dishes for each meal.

226
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,769
-That's okay with me.
-I'm not okay with it.

227
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,416
Mr. Nature.

228
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,545
I'll show you what real men eat.

229
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,130
<i>The part that's left on the meat...</i>

230
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,634
In the human world, men who can cook
are most popular these days.

231
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,135
<i>After that, we'll give it some time...</i>

232
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,262
That man is the most popular of all.

233
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,098
He has won all ladies' hearts with
just the way he sprinkles salt. My gosh!

234
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,642
Look at those arms. Oh, my!

235
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,561
<i>The texture will become denser</i>
<i>as it loses some moisture.</i>

236
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,813
How long are you going
to put on that stupid act?

237
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,398
It doesn't suit you.

238
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,566
Sorry?

239
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,780
<i>Chan-ho called this a beauty earlier.</i>

240
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,243
<i>People often describe this</i>
<i>as the sound of rain,</i>

241
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,828
<i>but I think it sounds like ocean waves.</i>
<i>Am I right?</i>

242
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,669
<i>-What's the herb you just put in?</i>
<i>-Rosemary.</i>

243
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,920
<i>I see, rosemary.</i>

244
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,799
It won't work.

245
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,342
<i>-Chef.</i>
<i>-Yes?</i>

246
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,735
It doesn't have to be so perfect.

247
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,905
Should I have shown him
<i>Temple Chef Master Beak </i>instead?

248
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,095
I should have shown you
<i>You Are A Natural Person.</i>

249
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,097
Thank you for the food.

250
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,474
You have amazing skills.

251
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,477
Don't talk about my superiority
in such a vulgar way.

252
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,937
All right.

253
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,314
I was a natural science student.
I'm not good at languages.

254
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,983
When I was still wet behind the ears,

255
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,402
I wrote many poems.

256
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,904
Do you know why I became a psychiatrist?

257
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,212
What did you just do?

258
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,511
You didn't have to.

259
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,854
As a token of my apology.

260
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,696
Are you going to do something bad to me?

261
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,493
You used to be wet behind the ears?

262
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,015
Why do I find it so funny?

263
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,017
I haven't laughed in forever.

264
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,186
You've probably wanted to laugh all along.

265
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,737
Oh, my!

266
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,577
The expiry date of this meat is today.

267
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,039
It's okay. I once ate meat
that had been expired for ten days.

268
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,251
-So you used to be wet behind the ears?
-Cut it out.

269
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,920
The meat tastes so good.

270
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,672
On a day like this, I don't want to
go back to the world of deities.

271
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,592
HABAEK
YUN SO-A

272
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,528
He must be suffering from
an obsessive-compulsive disorder.

273
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,197
He's obsessed with perfection,

274
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,865
and paranoid.

275
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,077
Park Sang-cheol...

276
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,746
had wanted to see me for a long time.

277
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,919
It was probably his final cry for help.

278
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,425
It was the same with Mr. Ma.

279
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,721
As a psychiatrist,

280
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,474
I didn't want to see
what I was supposed to see...

281
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,644
and didn't want to hear
what I was supposed to hear.

282
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,603
Would that be why?

283
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,146
How would I know?

284
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,737
I don't want to believe that.

285
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,743
I don't want to feel responsible
or guilty.

286
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,247
I don't want to live like that.

287
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,793
I want to only care about myself.

288
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,421
I...

289
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,715
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

290
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,014
-That's a relief.
-One thing is sure.

291
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,020
You won't be able to live
the way you want.

292
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,150
Why not?

293
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,777
You aren't born to live like that.

294
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,242
I'm interested in wheels,
so I did some research.

295
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,579
When you ride a bicycle,

296
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,499
you have to turn in the direction
you're about to fall.

297
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,379
Aren't you the only person
who doesn't know...

298
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,799
in which direction
your heart is about to fall?

299
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,219
If you try to turn in the other direction,

300
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,430
you'll fall and hurt yourself.

301
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,217
Thank you.

302
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,135
For what?

303
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,931
For...

304
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,225
saving my life again.

305
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,686
And...

306
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,940
for keeping me busy...

307
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,696
all day long.

308
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,666
CEO SHIN HU-YE

309
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,133
BRAGGING ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND

310
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,362
<i>FUNNIER THAN A COMEDIAN</i>

311
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,030
<i>WHY DO HUMAN BEINGS LAUGH?</i>

312
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,699
<i>FUNNY JOKES</i>

313
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,088
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION

314
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,381
2015 CEO AWARDS

315
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,592
FIRST PLACE
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY

316
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,640
Once I master how to be funny,

317
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,851
I'll be perfect.

318
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:36,024
I don't think we're close enough
to make jokes.

319
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,735
I thought we'd have
the same sense of humor.

320
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,454
-Yes?
-Are you studying jokes

321
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,705
in your office again?

322
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,499
I think I'll have to give up...

323
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,209
trying to be funny.

324
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,087
It's a side effect of being single.
Why don't you start dating someone?

325
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,590
Mr. Cho of Daehan Securities
and I go to the same church.

326
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,551
He keeps talking about his third daughter.
Do you want to meet her?

327
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,386
Please get to the point.

328
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,598
Mr. Cho wants to push back
our lunch appointment tomorrow 30 minutes.

329
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,016
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

330
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,936
-Sure.
-<i>Regarding the handkerchief,</i>

331
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,730
I'll call Ms. Shin tomorrow.

332
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,649
Handkerchief?

333
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,735
Okay.

334
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,911
I look so pretty. Why am I so pretty?

335
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,540
Busy day. Taking a pause.

336
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,126
I need you to cheer me up.

337
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,170
INVITED BY JA-YA

338
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,047
<i>-Oh, my. Is this Ja-ya?</i>
<i>-Hi.</i>

339
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,298
<i>Unbelievable. It's Ja-ya.</i>

340
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,634
<i>Ja-ya, I saw you eat </i>jajangmyeon.
<i>It was hilarious.</i>

341
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,220
<i>Ja-ya, you're gorgeous.</i>
<i>You look like an angel.</i>

342
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,556
<i>-What are you doing right now?</i>
<i>-I've been shooting all day.</i>

343
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,723
<i>Sad.</i>

344
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,435
<i>I just got off work,</i>
<i>and I'm having coffee on my way home.</i>

345
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,729
<i>How do you stay fit?</i>

346
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,023
<i>Give me some beauty tips.</i>

347
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,567
<i>This is Mr. Shin's secretary.</i>

348
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,318
What is it? He ruined the mood.

349
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,320
<i>When are you going to</i>
<i>return the handkerchief?</i>

350
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,155
What handkerchief?

351
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,617
Wipe your face. You're a star.

352
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,496
Why? Does Mr. Shin want it back?

353
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,875
Gosh, he's so petty.

354
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,295
He's rich. Tell him to buy a new one.

355
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,130
How petty.

356
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:23,840
<i>It's mine.</i>

357
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,758
<i>My ex-girlfriend gave it to me as a gift,</i>

358
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,094
-<i>so I'd like to get it back.</i>
-What? It was his?

359
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,762
Wait.

360
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,226
I'm speechless.

361
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,363
I threw out that handkerchief right away.
Pass this message along to Shin Hu-ye.

362
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,617
How can he give me someone else's
handkerchief? Why did he do that?

363
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,536
He didn't want to dirty his handkerchief
with my tears?

364
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,456
I see. I'm also sick and tired
of wasting my emotions like this,

365
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,167
so tell him to get out of my life.

366
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,669
I hope Beriwon Resort
becomes an epic fail too.

367
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,588
Make sure you tell him what I just said.

368
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,805
What's going on?
Why isn't he saying anything?

369
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,600
Did he leave the chatroom?

370
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,144
Unbelievable. How rude!

371
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,067
<i>Ja-ya, what was that about?</i>

372
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,693
<i>Ja-ya, do you have a crush on someone?</i>

373
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,279
<i>-I hope he likes you back.</i>
<i>-Ja-ya, are you seeing that guy?</i>

374
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,114
<i>Could he be the CEO, Shin Hu-ye?</i>

375
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,076
<i>Ja-ya would never do that.</i>
<i>Why aren't you denying it?</i>

376
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,079
<i>She must be mad because he rejected her</i>
<i>when she made a move on him.</i>

377
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,039
<i>-Who is Ja-ya?</i>
<i>-You'll know when you see her.</i>

378
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,832
<i>She appears on some shows here and there.</i>

379
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,502
What is this? What is happening?

380
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,629
What did I just do?

381
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,717
-Hello?
-Ja-ya, I heard that Mr. Shin dumped you.

382
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,011
Goodness, did you ask your fans
for sympathy?

383
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,347
<i>Boss wants to see you right now.</i>

384
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,732
-You should sort it out.
-What happened?

385
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,402
Send out a press release saying
it was part of your marketing strategy

386
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,488
or do a press conference.
Whatever you do, you must sort it out now!

387
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,788
What's she talking about?

388
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,999
She's probably humiliated.

389
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,921
IS SHIN JA-YA DATING
THE CEO OF BERIWON RESORT?

390
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,262
<i>"Gossip on the internet dies down</i>
<i>and goes away quickly.</i>

391
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,722
<i>Don't let it concern you."</i>

392
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,223
What's he saying now?

393
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,350
<i>Mr. Shin wanted me</i>
<i>to pass this message along to you.</i>

394
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,768
That little...

395
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,562
MR. JANG

396
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,690
-What's up?
-Are you and Mr. Shin related?

397
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,609
Why didn't you tell me?

398
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,447
-Don't fight with your relative.
-Cut it out. He's not my relative!

399
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,643
Seriously.

400
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,605
I told you not to come here.
You never listen to me.

401
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,984
Can't you try to be more friendly?
You haven't seen me in years.

402
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,361
Hey! Don't take that off.

403
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,989
Can you please try to be
considerate of my eyes?

404
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,911
You haven't changed one bit.

405
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,997
Only meeting that jerk
in the divine world will tame you.

406
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,040
"That jerk"?

407
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,333
Who?

408
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,876
You know.

409
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,545
Your high priest told us about him
when we were young.

410
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,380
The jerk who will kill everyone.

411
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,007
Are you talking about that again?

412
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,343
That's why I always say that
you're more immature than Habaek.

413
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,471
Aren't you old enough to know
that you shouldn't believe it?

414
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,105
You must still believe the story of
the bear turning into a woman too.

415
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,025
Isn't the story of the man hatching
out of an egg more interesting?

416
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,031
What will you do now?

417
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,616
Do you have a plan or what?

418
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,702
Tell him you'll give it to him
after he gets mine first.

419
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,663
I'll say I can only give him mine
after he gets yours.

420
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,207
Do you actually think
that can be called a strategy?

421
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,875
It'll buy us time. All right?

422
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,045
So where's the self-proclaimed
most superior god?

423
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,506
That idiot is the first god

424
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,508
to actually get help
from a divine servant.

425
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,427
A divine servant?

426
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,056
"Blessed Mental Health.

427
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,017
Doctor Yun So-a"?

428
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,687
-Is it a woman?
-Yes.

429
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,729
She irks me.

430
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,316
I don't even think she knows
Habaek is the God of Water.

431
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,235
Why do you think that?

432
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,198
I can't tell you.

433
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,270
What is this place?

434
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,110
Where are we now?

435
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,279
-What are you trying to do?
-Don't you remember?

436
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,822
Remember what?

437
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,700
<i>Last night, you drank</i>
<i>the entire bottle of my digestif</i>

438
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,453
<i>all by yourself,</i>
<i>saying that you were in a great mood.</i>

439
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,790
<i>Then you insisted that you had</i>
<i>to sleep on Namsuri's bed.</i>

440
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,294
I did?

441
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,672
Sleeping outside in the cold can
paralyze your face.

442
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,674
<i>After saying that sleeping</i>
<i>outside in the cold</i>

443
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,718
<i>can cause facial paralysis,</i>
<i>which didn't make sense,</i>

444
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,556
<i>you slowly crawled into my room...</i>

445
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,559
<i>like an invertebrate.</i>

446
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,952
I guess I made a mistake.

447
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,828
I looked it up on the internet.

448
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,875
That symptom you exhibited
is called "drunken rampage."

449
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,544
That's not true.

450
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,149
Oh, right. Namsuri.

451
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,818
Namsuri.

452
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,070
Namsuri.

453
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,196
Oh, hey.

454
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,282
Why are you coming out of there?

455
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,292
-Did the two of you--
-No, not at all.

456
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:15,960
No.

457
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,845
Hello?

458
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,847
<i>I heard that Habaek</i>
<i>doesn't have a cell phone.</i>

459
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:28,973
Who is this?

460
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,102
Lord Biryeom!

461
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,606
Gosh, that was crazy.

462
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,150
I must have lost my mind.

463
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,901
Gosh, my entire body aches.

464
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,698
What a heartless god.

465
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,743
He should've given me a blanket.
He should've at least given me a pillow...

466
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,785
What am I saying now?

467
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,746
He obviously doesn't have one.

468
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,665
-Lord Biryeom, this is Namsuri.
-<i>Where's Habaek?</i>

469
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,793
He's here. I'll pass the phone to him.

470
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,503
Pardon me?

471
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,048
Sure.

472
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,551
-What did he say?
-He wants you to come over.

473
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,053
He'll text us the address.

474
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,721
I guess Mura tracked him down.

475
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,807
I think you should regain your power
before meeting him.

476
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,685
You can't expose Ms. Descendant
to danger again, though.

477
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,563
I still feel so bad
about fooling her like that.

478
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,732
What does that mean?

479
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,701
Did you...

480
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,829
try to kill me on purpose?

481
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,914
No.

482
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,750
Is that why you apologized to me?

483
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,669
Did you want to apologize
before killing me?

484
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,255
I said no.

485
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,716
Is that why you sliced my steak
and apologized...

486
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,182
just so that you can attempt
to kill me again?

487
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,975
Was it like the Last Supper?

488
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,227
That's not what happened.

489
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,770
Stop lying to my face.

490
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,147
You let me get in that car
when you knew everything,

491
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,774
just to regain your stupid power.

492
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,860
-"Stupid power"?
-That's right, your stupid power.

493
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,530
I don't know how amazing your power is,

494
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,366
but how can a god be willing
to sacrifice someone's life for it?

495
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,742
How can a god be so selfish?

496
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,629
He was confident that his power
would come back again to save you.

497
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,174
Is that even an excuse?

498
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,135
Had he not regained his power
right at that moment,

499
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,803
what do you think would've happened to me?

500
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,097
He would've saved your life at all costs.

501
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,475
But that doesn't change the fact
that he used me.

502
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,688
The fact that he has saved your life twice
won't change either.

503
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,231
Namsuri.

504
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,236
Why are you so chatty?

505
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,280
Let's go.

506
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,200
We should return to the divine realm
as soon as possible.

507
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,244
It'll be good for you as well.

508
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,394
I'll go with you.

509
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,730
-I have something to collect.
-What?

510
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,106
The money you spent.

511
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,194
I have the receipts,
so I'll settle it with them.

512
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,071
I'll tell them to hand over the stones
or take you.

513
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,407
Let's see what those great gods look like.

514
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,076
-Should I start driving?
-Yes.

515
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,834
He hasn't changed.

516
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,504
He always liked high places,
even in the Land of the Sky.

517
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,631
The gods should be lowering themselves,

518
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,257
but one is a huge star,

519
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,511
and the other lives in
the most expensive penthouse.

520
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,934
Is the world cruddy
because the gods are like that?

521
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,393
Or did the gods give up

522
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,854
and are like that
because the world is so cruddy?

523
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,399
You grow ruder by the minute.

524
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,737
I'm reminded of that worm
who kept begging me to marry him.

525
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,949
He gave me a diamond ring
this big when he proposed,

526
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,951
but I rejected him.

527
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,038
Yeom-mi!

528
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,957
Hi, So-a. What are you doing here?

529
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,750
I thought you had three jobs
during vacation.

530
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,211
-Have you seen Bin lately?
-Ahn Bin?

531
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,255
He dropped out and went to study in Rome.

532
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,131
-What?
-He's so funny.

533
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,550
He was always top of the class,

534
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,843
but he said medicine isn't his thing
and quit.

535
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,012
He really must've gone to school for fun.

536
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,598
Why do you ask?

537
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,601
I wanted to return this.

538
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,896
I should've just married him.

539
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,398
He was super wealthy.

540
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,280
He bragged about living here too.

541
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,120
-Long time no see, Biryeom.
-Long time no see, So-a.

542
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,176
Is it a hobby of hers to faint?

543
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,845
She faints all the time.

544
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:34,236
-It's been a while, Namsuri.
-How have you been, Lord Biryeom?

545
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,742
I can't believe my friend So-a
was the divine servant.

546
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,411
No wonder I was drawn to her.

547
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,637
Losing your power doesn't mean
you lose your divinity.

548
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,722
I've never once lost my power,

549
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,182
so I was curious.

550
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,278
Long time no see, So-a.

551
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,704
My divinity is fine,
so give me the sacred stone.

552
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,873
I'm sure you know already,
but you can't take it from me.

553
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,458
You should know the reason.

554
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,752
However, if you get it from Mura first,

555
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,629
I'll consider it.

556
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,798
Lord Biryeom.

557
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,978
Long time no see, So-a.

558
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:00,781
Right?

559
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,991
Remember how you and Mura used to be.

560
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,870
Isn't it a problem
if she won't hand it over?

561
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,665
That's why we protect
the sacred stones, after all.

562
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,293
-Lord Biryeom...
-That's right.

563
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,465
I heard you even feel hunger,
is that right?

564
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,679
Yes.
I've experienced the pain of betrayal...

565
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,848
and hunger.

566
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,517
I feel like I became a better king
yesterday than the day before

567
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,310
and today than yesterday.

568
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,148
-What?
-I'm saying

569
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,275
I'm learning how to be a good king.

570
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,864
Let's go, Namsuri.

571
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,245
Leave her.

572
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,081
I haven't seen her in a while.
We have much to talk about.

573
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,387
Even Lady Mura won't give it to you.

574
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,306
Of course, Lord Biryeom won't either.

575
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,949
It may be a hobby for you,

576
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,744
but you're harassing the employees
in a passive-aggressive way.

577
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,580
Tell them if they worry about it,
I'll fire them.

578
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,709
The product development team
asked about Ms. Yun's contract.

579
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:40,005
It ended up looking like
you're handling it yourself.

580
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,759
-I guess she's still reviewing it.
-I thought she'd sign right away.

581
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,844
The land has been passed down
for generations,

582
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,388
so she must be hesitating, I'm sure.

583
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,891
She acts tough,

584
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,602
but she's very sensitive on the inside.

585
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,145
Pardon?

586
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,732
She's a good person through and through.

587
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,901
She doesn't want to get caught
or have anyone find out,

588
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,694
so she acts the complete opposite.

589
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,240
That's why the plans keep going awry.

590
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,118
That isn't what I asked.

591
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,247
Isn't it fun to watch her
pretend to be a villain?

592
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,416
-Does that answer your question?
-Yes, sir.

593
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,378
She's a psychiatrist after all.

594
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,255
Want to know a secret?

595
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,299
I see through people's emotions.

596
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,054
That is the secret
to my success in business.

597
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,058
I'll call Ms. Yun myself.

598
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,810
Okay, sir.

599
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,104
BERIWON RESORT

600
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,100
I'll go with you.

601
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,977
Long time no see, So-a.

602
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,148
What's wrong with me?

603
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,650
What a random dream.

604
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,779
What kind of a dream has
an introduction and a plot twist?

605
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,367
I'm speechless.

606
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,056
What do you guys think you're doing?

607
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,642
Don't try to sneak your way in here.

608
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,561
I heard that diamond ring...

609
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,563
wasn't a proposal ring.

610
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,402
It was a friendship ring.

611
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,198
A friendship ring.
Did Bin give it to you?

612
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,242
I thought he'd given you
a different ring for love.

613
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,954
I heard about 20 kids got the same ring.

614
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:23,418
I heard he gave it to more than 20 people,
and that he never chased you.

615
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,381
Do you have delusions of grandeur?

616
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,969
What? You're going to settle the score?

617
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,347
You couldn't say a single word.

618
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,849
Don't faint!

619
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,439
You faint whenever
things don't go your way.

620
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,735
<i>No way.</i>

621
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,571
<i>No way!</i>

622
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,282
<i>Anyway, be careful of Biryeom.</i>

623
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,618
Not all gods are the same.

624
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,583
He was born from the back of
the Goddess of Love.

625
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,043
You know what that means, right?

626
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,380
Her back.

627
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,591
From the back of the Goddess of Love.

628
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,885
He enjoys betrayal and turmoil.

629
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,096
Hence, you should not even talk to him.

630
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,557
Bin is a god?

631
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,685
Bin is...

632
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,022
Bin is a god?

633
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,899
She's completely out of it.

634
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,363
Why don't you go back to Lady Mura?

635
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,825
Where on earth is Lord Judong?

636
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,411
Bin...

637
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:41,872
Bin...

638
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,667
Bin is...

639
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,825
What is it? Why did you want to meet?

640
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,664
You didn't have to tell Biryeom
that I lost my power.

641
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,374
I had no choice.

642
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,961
He said if you give him yours,
he may give him his as well.

643
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,547
Give it to me. You trust me.

644
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,634
I'll get my power back
once I return, anyway.

645
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,135
No, I can't.

646
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,846
-I can't.
-Mura.

647
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,515
Get it from Biryeom.

648
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,725
-Then I'll give you mine.
-Lady Mura.

649
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,393
I can't decide on my own.

650
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,021
Lady Mura!

651
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,654
I'm sorry,

652
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,864
but I have no choice.

653
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,868
I'm getting excited.

654
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,665
It's been a while since we worked together
to get Habaek.

655
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,791
What are you yapping about?

656
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,585
-What did I do with you before?
-I proposed.

657
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,629
And, of course, I'm still waiting.

658
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,840
Although it didn't make Habaek jealous,
as you hoped.

659
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,342
-Hey!
-Let's go. I'm busy.

660
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,428
I have to see an old friend,
and I have work to do.

661
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,645
Long time no see, So-a.

662
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,313
Long time no see, So-a.

663
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,233
No way.

664
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,527
No way.

665
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,580
<i>The phone has been turned off.</i>
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

666
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,750
Yeom-mi.

667
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,462
Bin is...

668
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,465
Bin is...

669
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,427
When did you come in?

670
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,513
Doctor!

671
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,849
Mr. Shin called several times.

672
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,601
He said he couldn't reach you.

673
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,318
I had no time to look over the contract.

674
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,945
What could be more important
than selling the land?

675
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,071
I know.

676
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,125
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hello, this is Yun So-a.

677
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,543
Finally, you called.

678
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,836
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

679
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,130
I called because I hadn't heard back
about the contract.

680
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,592
I'm sorry. I haven't had a chance
to review it yet.

681
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,969
<i>I'm on my way out to a meeting near you.</i>

682
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,512
<i>I have some free time.</i>

683
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,599
<i>If you're ready,</i>
<i>I can meet with you first.</i>

684
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,518
Why don't we meet
at the cafe by my clinic?

685
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,562
I'll look at it right now.

686
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:01,154
-What do you plan to ask Ms. Descendant?
-About Mura and Biryeom.

687
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,822
-I have my suspicions.
-Excuse me?

688
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,325
What could she possibly know?

689
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,160
When I learned how to read her language,

690
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,454
I looked into what it is
that she does for a living.

691
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:14,000
I need to check something about Mura
and Biryeom's mental states.

692
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:23,802
Oh, my gosh!

693
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,512
What?

694
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,514
Why are you here?

695
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,016
I was disappointed
that you left like that.

696
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:31,851
I wanted to catch up

697
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,813
and talk about your being
the divine servant.

698
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,858
I'd like to talk here,
but I need to work too,

699
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,318
so I need to be efficient.

700
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,697
Hey. Let go of me. Hey.

701
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,824
Hey!

702
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,925
Isn't that Lord Biryeom?

703
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,855
Hey. Stop the car!

704
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,190
Hey!

705
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:20,984
Biryeom!

706
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,323
You've heard the expression
"gone with the wind," right?

707
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,616
-I'll show you.
-What?

708
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,287
I'm going to report you.

709
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,123
Report...

710
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,752
-Hey!
-Don't worry.

711
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,337
I'll buy you the latest phone.

712
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,505
No!

713
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:42,649
<i>The phone has been turned off.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

714
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,234
DR. YUN SO-A

715
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,384
Wait a second.

716
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,149
It's a mutation.
It isn't time for repression yet.

717
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,777
Resentment is what fits right now.
This is a temporary prescription.

718
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,696
Why...

719
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,698
Why, you...

720
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,200
Want to hear a secret?

721
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,370
We aren't omniscient and omnipotent.

722
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,540
For example, we can't revive something
from the dead.

723
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,543
If humans keep ignoring nature's warnings,

724
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,003
they will all die.

725
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,673
But it's strange.

726
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,093
Everyone I gave a ring to
became successful.

727
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,266
Why are you such a mess?
Did you throw away the ring?

728
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,684
What do you think you're doing?

729
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,230
From what I recall,
you were a poor student.

730
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,691
I quit school because of you,

731
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,402
-so that you could win the scholarship.
-What nonsense.

732
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,281
Why did you go into psychiatry?

733
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,116
You would've made more money
in other fields.

734
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,411
You rushed to open a clinic
and are still swimming in debt.

735
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,414
I hear you can't even afford
to pay your rent now.

736
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,011
It's bigger than the old one, right?

737
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,075
You need to do something
as the divine servant.

738
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,660
Make Habaek drink this.

739
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,954
-Then the ring is yours.
-What?

740
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,455
It'll make him temporarily forget
the sacred stones.

741
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,332
I need to do something in the meantime.

742
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:08,628
Of course, you'll be rewarded.
The ring is a bonus.

743
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,255
I can grant you a wish.

744
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,925
For example, to become wealthier
than Sheikh Mansour.

745
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,009
Hey.

746
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,804
Wealthier than Sheikh Mansour?

747
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,992
Be careful with it.
It's very precious. One of a kind.

748
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,839
Sort out your problems
amongst yourselves.

749
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,842
And my wish isn't to become wealthier
than Sheikh Mansour.

750
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,930
One: You aren't Habaek's servant,
but all gods' servant.

751
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:05,268
Two: Habaek has lost his power,
so he can't do anything for you.

752
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,231
Simply put, choose wisely
with whom you align yourself.

753
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,860
Sorry, but he does have that power.

754
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,654
It comes and goes right now,
but losing his power

755
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,240
doesn't mean he stops being a god.

756
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,199
What?

757
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,911
They'll be back eventually.

758
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,205
Why are you running after them
like it's a big deal?

759
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,000
I can't trust that jerk.

760
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,252
You never cared what Biryeom did.

761
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,342
Don't tell me you're doing this
because of her.

762
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,769
Are you done?

763
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,688
-I have a patient to see tonight.
-I want to ask Habaek

764
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,691
if what you say is true right now.

765
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,577
Why are you always causing trouble?

766
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,204
We meet again.

767
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,206
Come here.

768
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,466
Hey!

769
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,053
Hey!

770
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:27,892
Hey!

771
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,155
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

772
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,991
Apparently, Habaek hasn't
completely lost his power.

773
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,244
-What?
-Here's your chance to prove it.

774
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,621
If I see you regain your power,
even momentarily,

775
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,332
I'll seriously consider giving you
the sacred stone.

776
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,792
What is he talking about?

777
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,422
Hey! What are you doing?

778
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,069
Hey!

779
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,116
Hey! Stop it, you jerk!

780
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,159
-Not yet.
-Stop it!

781
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,703
One more step, and I'll drop her.

782
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,042
What are you doing?

783
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,759
Lord Biryeom, you are not permitted
to harass humans.

784
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:47,013
Divine servants are an exception.
Blessings, punishments, glory, and pain.

785
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,932
-Gods can give them as they wish.
-That's nonsense!

786
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,894
Look, I don't like her either.
But this isn't right.

787
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,522
His power returns
whenever her life is in danger.

788
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,024
Aren't you curious too?

789
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,817
Why?

790
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,612
Are you ready?

791
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,363
Let's begin.

792
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,963
What do we do?

793
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,260
Lord Biryeom, please stop.

794
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,638
What if his power doesn't return?

795
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:32,725
Then I'll assume this is where
she is destined to perish.

796
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,687
Okay. What do you say?
It's really your turn now.

797
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,572
Hey!

798
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,995
You guys lost the sacred stones,
didn't you?

799
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,335
Hey!

800
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,390
How did you...

801
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,226
lose the sacred stones?

802
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,169
<i>It feels like I've been watching</i>
<i>a romantic comedy all day.</i>

803
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,297
<i>What kind of deadly sins did they commit</i>

804
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,299
<i>to make you guys think of my life</i>
<i>and fate as your playthings?</i>

805
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,801
<i>You even had a fight at the end.</i>
<i>It's perfect.</i>

806
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,595
I don't want you
to fall for another human girl.

807
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,013
<i>If you keep doing this...</i>

808
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,765
<i>-He's a bad person.</i>
<i>-He's going to leave anyway.</i>

809
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,225
<i>He's going to leave anyway.</i>

810
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,352
<i>-Are you all right?</i>
<i>-But he stirred up your heart.</i>

811
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,771
<i>I'm currently paying for having a dream</i>

812
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,982
<i>that I couldn't handle.</i>

813
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,651
<i>I don't want you to remember</i>
<i>the pain and despair from the old days.</i>

814
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,194
<i>So-a!</i>
