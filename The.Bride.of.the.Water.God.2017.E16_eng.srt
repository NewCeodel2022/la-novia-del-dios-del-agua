1
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,735
The person who saved you will be
the Grim Reaper who takes away your soul.

2
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,944
It means you're going to die.

3
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,071
What?

4
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,628
Oh, hello.

5
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,547
What are you guys talking about?

6
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,719
-It's nothing.
-I'm not done yet.

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,139
-There's a surprising turn of events
-Yeom-mi.

8
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,141
It's not your boyfriend.

9
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,021
At first, I also thought it'd be him.

10
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,566
But the man in the wet running shoes
finally revealed himself.

11
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,862
It was an older man.

12
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,615
-An older man?
-Yes.

13
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,409
I'm so glad that it's not
your boyfriend here, but...

14
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,787
What?

15
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,915
This man.

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,750
It's him.

17
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,008
What?

18
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,473
This man. Who is he?
Why do you have a picture of him?

19
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,914
Hey.

20
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,835
-How have you been?
-Where the heck have you been?

21
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,754
I thought I'd be able to take care
of the business sooner, but...

22
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:10,839
What business?

23
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,098
Hello.

24
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,184
There's no need to greet him.
You, over there.

25
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,145
So-a's friend, Jo Yeom-mi.

26
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,273
How about you get going now?

27
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,358
This woman and I don't have much time.

28
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,908
Who is that?

29
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,369
Just go home. Knowing too much
isn't good for your sake.

30
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,912
But what should we do about my dream?

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,206
-The Grim Reaper is your dad--
-Stop spewing nonsense.

32
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,125
You just had a bad dream.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,628
Hey, I clearly saw your dad.
It was that man in the photo.

34
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,714
-This is--
-What you said doesn't make sense.

35
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,008
-Why not?
-You said the one who saved me

36
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,092
will take away my soul.

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,763
But my dad has never once saved me.

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,645
Get going.
And just forget about that stupid dream.

39
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,859
Go on.

40
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,594
Why is this...

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,897
Why did he do something so pointless?

42
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,024
You went to look for the tablet?

43
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,401
We don't have to find it,
but I had a bad feeling about it.

44
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,654
-It took longer than I thought.
-Did you find it?

45
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738
No, not exactly.

46
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,406
I just found its remnants.

47
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,826
-I need to put the pieces together.
-Whatever it is, do it at Mura's place.

48
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,411
I'm busy, so don't bother me.

49
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,080
The messenger must've come.

50
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,082
How much time do you have?

51
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,583
Six days.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,086
I heard you went back and came back.

53
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,173
Are you thinking about not going back?

54
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,676
You know that's the worst move
you can make, right?

55
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
That much I know.

56
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,763
It's not like I can stay here
if I choose not to go back.

57
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,181
Right.

58
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,268
-I should say goodbye to her.
-Hey.

59
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,438
This way.

60
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,608
He's leaving.

61
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,402
Goodbye.

62
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,155
You're two peas in a pod.
Neither of you is asking me to stay.

63
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,241
Is that your father?

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,578
Yes.

65
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,582
Did he make his daughter carry his burden?

66
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,834
-Still no word from him?
-Pardon me?

67
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,669
Do you want to find him?

68
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,175
Get going. Stop saying useless things.

69
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,594
Have a good time!

70
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,097
Jeez, I'm leaving.

71
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,017
Make sure you shut the door properly.

72
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,461
Do this.

73
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,714
Who knows when you'll do this yourself
after I leave?

74
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,471
Saying you've forgotten someone
means the opposite.

75
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,641
Saying you hate someone means
you don't actually hate that person.

76
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,937
Part of your heart stays intact
even when everything falls apart.

77
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,525
When you lie, it's so obvious.

78
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,654
That's you.

79
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,169
You said...

80
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,715
your wish was to meet your father
and tell him everything.

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,261
I'm sorry I never got to make
that wish of yours come true.

82
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,348
I'm a god.

83
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,187
I'm sorry I couldn't even do that for you
as a god.

84
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,067
So...

85
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,654
I hope you can try to find him
after I leave.

86
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,574
Do your best to find him.

87
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,953
Even if your father turns out
to be the worst man in the world,

88
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,539
you should find him.

89
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,545
Like you said,
you're now old enough to handle it.

90
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,255
Find him,

91
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,424
get the answer,

92
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,968
lift the weight off your mind,

93
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,971
and escape that darkness.

94
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,227
The thought of you...

95
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,607
still confined in that darkness
even after I leave...

96
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,486
drives me crazy.

97
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,137
Go check on him.

98
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,932
See if he is ready to leave.

99
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,933
He will leave.

100
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,061
-I'm getting a bad feeling.
-He will leave.

101
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,606
He knows what will happen otherwise.
He won't do something so foolish.

102
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,541
Judong is here.

103
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,549
Where on earth have you been?

104
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,594
If you block your signals again,
we'll cut you off.

105
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,138
Habaek kicked me out.

106
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,265
You met him?

107
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,561
I heard the messenger came.

108
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,480
-He won't do something stupid, will he?
-No, I don't think so.

109
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,607
So you've been looking for the tablet?

110
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,653
Yes. I thought I'd find it around the spot
where I fell, but I couldn't.

111
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,823
Then I realized I might have lost it
somewhere else,

112
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,994
so I went looking for it
all over the country, retracing my steps.

113
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,245
That's why it took so long.

114
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,497
-But you couldn't find it?
-No.

115
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,166
But I at least know who took it.

116
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,336
Who? Humans can't even see it.

117
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,923
Some humans can.

118
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,346
Can I sleep here tonight? I have to
visit some places starting tomorrow.

119
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,764
-No!
-No!

120
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,529
Love is the problem.

121
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,742
-Namsuri.
-<i>Lord Judong.</i>

122
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,410
<i>Where are you?</i>

123
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,245
I'm on the street.

124
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,122
<i>Why? Did you see Habaek?</i>

125
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,833
He kicked me out. Where are you?

126
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,710
Can't you let me in?

127
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,338
I'm working. I can't go home tonight.

128
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,215
You're leaving anyway.
Why must you work so hard?

129
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,509
Lord Habaek wants me
to earn a lot of money.

130
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,969
Fine. I have to go.

131
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,097
Gosh, money is the problem.

132
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,941
-What are you doing here?
-I have an emergency.

133
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,526
"The Grim Reaper"?

134
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,321
Ms. Descendant is going to die?

135
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,697
Yes.

136
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,660
Do you hate her so much
that you wish she'd die?

137
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,664
-Dreams show our subconscious desires.
-I thought it was a precognitive dream.

138
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,083
But my precognitive abilities
are rather weak,

139
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,542
so I need to strengthen them...

140
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,379
with your help.

141
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,090
And you're leaving soon.

142
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,763
What?

143
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,893
Hello. 50 chickens? Sure.

144
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,748
He rarely sleeps in.

145
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,727
I waited for you to come wake me up.

146
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,270
Why?

147
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,107
Just because.

148
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,740
I have a present for you.

149
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,622
I wanted to buy you
the fanciest gift I could get

150
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,668
but couldn't find anything nicer
than what your goddess friend gave you.

151
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,672
So I just picked one
that would suit you best.

152
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,180
I've been telling you
that I'd buy you some clothes.

153
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,767
Wear this on our date today.

154
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,685
-"Our date"?
-Yes.

155
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,312
Like we talked about last time.

156
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:55,065
We'll have some good food,
do fun things, and go shopping.

157
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,235
Today, tomorrow,
and the day after tomorrow.

158
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,615
Let's leave the car at home.
We'll walk and take the bus and subway.

159
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,700
-Just because.
-Just because.

160
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,180
Here.

161
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,812
Rock-paper-scissors.

162
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,313
Yes!

163
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,357
Here you go.

164
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,025
Rock-paper-scissors.

165
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,325
Why do you lose every time?

166
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,332
-One more round.
-Oh, the bus is here.

167
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,668
Or maybe not.

168
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,713
It's nice to be out, isn't it?

169
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,007
-Especially with me, right?
-Yes.

170
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,304
I'm thirsty too.

171
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,397
-Their specialty is cold soybean noodles.
-But you don't eat cold food.

172
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,607
I want to try.

173
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,068
Wouldn't it be nice
if at least one problem was solved?

174
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,153
I want to show you.

175
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,784
All right, then. Let me try.

176
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,561
It wasn't that bad at all.

177
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,938
I didn't have to be so scared.

178
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,233
What a shame.

179
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,652
Why are you laughing?

180
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,189
Habaek.

181
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,360
What? Because I called your name?

182
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,614
It's okay with everyone else.

183
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,326
But with you, I was afraid...

184
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,996
my feelings would show
if I called your name.

185
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
I didn't want you to see them.

186
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,879
Habaek.

187
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,592
We had noodles today.
You can play rock-paper-scissors, right?

188
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,471
If you win, he will draw a portrait of us.

189
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,765
Only if you win, that is.

190
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,850
If you lose, you get nothing.

191
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,606
Rock-paper-scissors!

192
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,401
One more time. Rock-paper-scissors!

193
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,194
You're quite good.

194
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,613
Rock-paper-scissors!

195
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,741
You won!

196
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,702
Good job.

197
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,287
Please excuse us for a moment.

198
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,671
Please sit down. She'll be back soon.

199
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,051
You're very good at rock-paper-scissors.

200
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,720
What's your secret?

201
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,931
"Secret"? Such a crude word
can't explain my excellence.

202
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,017
You see, I never lose.

203
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,145
You're very impressive.

204
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,777
It looks like your bride asked my wife
to prepare something for her.

205
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,697
My bride?

206
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,534
Look. There she is.

207
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,517
Do I look pretty?

208
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,729
Habaek?

209
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,359
Do I look pretty?

210
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,653
Yes.

211
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,247
Photographs...

212
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,583
fade with time, you know.

213
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,255
I heard that pencil lead
is made with a material

214
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,465
that never fades away,
no matter how much time passes.

215
00:18:55,551 --> 00:19:00,472
Your face will be remembered more vividly
than it looks in photographs,

216
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,394
so I thought it'd be better to leave
a portrait that would never fade away.

217
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,861
You have to face this way
for me to draw you.

218
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,493
The groom, please.

219
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,459
Hold on a second!

220
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,215
I forgot this.

221
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
You two look picturesquely beautiful.

222
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,395
All right.

223
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,170
Oh, my.

224
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,298
What a nice office.

225
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,765
You don't need to feel bad.

226
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,975
Although it is true
that you put me through a lot.

227
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,477
I'm sorry.

228
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,855
That's how life goes.
Don't worry about it.

229
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,233
Actually, there's something
I want to ask you.

230
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,402
-What is it?
-I'm looking for someone,

231
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,073
and I think that person is in your life.

232
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,282
Who are you looking for?

233
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,452
Shall I say it's the person who saved you?

234
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,996
The person... who saved me?

235
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,333
I lost the tablet that day.

236
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,754
So, while backtracking from that spot,

237
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,673
<i>I ended up retracing your steps as well.</i>

238
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,175
<i>I found out that your stepmother,</i>
<i>Shin Mi-jeong,</i>

239
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,010
<i>found you wandering around the Divine Gate</i>

240
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,179
<i>and took you home that day,</i>

241
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,765
as well as the fact
that there was one more person.

242
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,850
Yes, that's right.

243
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,185
That night,

244
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,646
hours after you left,

245
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,189
a man found me.

246
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,858
He took me to the hospital and left,

247
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,028
but I found out who he was
through the traces that he had left.

248
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,198
He was the man you met.

249
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,493
Why are you looking for him, though?

250
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,997
It looks like he found it and took it.

251
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,708
Did he tell you where he was headed?

252
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,502
He said in passing
that he was going to meet someone.

253
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,171
I was in critical condition,

254
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,090
so my mother and I left first.

255
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,467
Later on, my mother told me

256
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,095
that he was on his way
to his wife's grave, which was nearby.

257
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,639
He had returned from abroad
after being away for a year,

258
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,142
and he didn't know about his wife's death.

259
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,811
We never heard from him after that day.

260
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,563
My mother tried very hard to find him,

261
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,564
but she couldn't.

262
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,482
His wife's grave.

263
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,485
But I remember him saying that day...

264
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,613
that there's someone
he really has to meet.

265
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,240
Who?

266
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,242
-His daughter.
-His daughter?

267
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,164
-Is his name Yun...
-Yes.

268
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,499
My mother said his name is Yun Seong-jun.

269
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,838
The night of December 20, 2004?

270
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,174
Yes, that night.

271
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,384
Do you happen to remember
where you were that night?

272
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,601
The human brain
can't even remember yesterday.

273
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,478
How could she remember
something that long ago?

274
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,938
-You should leave.
-Tell me. Where were you?

275
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,024
Don't you keep journals?

276
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,776
Can you try to find your journal?

277
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,783
What's this ruse now?

278
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,618
Why are you here?
Why did you ask her that?

279
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,912
That's the day I went missing, you know.

280
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,872
What does that have to do with her?

281
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,209
Her father,

282
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,628
Yun Seong-jun, must've taken my tablet.

283
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,339
-What?
-I retraced everywhere I've been.

284
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,716
Then I suddenly remembered something.

285
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,676
The man who took me to the hospital

286
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,387
and the cell phone number he left.

287
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,097
I tracked that number.

288
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,890
It belongs to Yun Seong-jun,

289
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,643
our servant's father. In other words,
another servant of ours.

290
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,693
What was that about?

291
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,156
Why does he want to know
what I did that day?

292
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,793
<i>It answered all the questions that I had.</i>

293
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,046
He must've noticed it
because it's the divine servants' tablet.

294
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,840
Divine objects aren't visible to humans,

295
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,259
but servants can see the servants' tablet.

296
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,178
He probably picked it up
thinking that it belongs to me,

297
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,514
and I'm sure he was going
to give it to me when I woke up.

298
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,808
Since I didn't give it to him myself,

299
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,601
he wouldn't have been awakened.

300
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,978
But...

301
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,440
why did you ask So-a
where she was that night?

302
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,816
Even without him being awakened,

303
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,111
the tablet must've recognized the servant.
Do you get what I'm trying to say?

304
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,075
Before Yun Seong-jun found me that night,

305
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,537
he met that halfie. He saved him first.

306
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,372
That guy told me

307
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,040
that Yun Seong-jun said

308
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,501
he had to go meet his daughter.

309
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,588
The tablet has...

310
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:30,302
the power to grant
a divine servant's deepest wish.

311
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,511
Exactly!

312
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:35,849
Yun Seong-jun's deepest wish
must've reached the tablet that night,

313
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,810
and the tablet must've taken him
to his daughter.

314
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,647
Now, where was she that night?

315
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,237
Come back and see me just once, Dad.

316
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,159
Then I'll forgive you for everything.

317
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,340
<i>Come on in.</i>

318
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,011
My gosh, you seem much more at ease.

319
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,596
So? Why did you want to see me?

320
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,434
What's the tablet that gods carry around?

321
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,189
That's actually for their servants.
It reminds them that they're descendants

322
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,233
of the family that has served
as gods' servants.

323
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,193
It is a divine object,

324
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,987
so it's not even visible to other humans.

325
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,866
Only the descendants of the family
can see it. Why do you ask?

326
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,118
<i>His daughter?</i>

327
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,997
-Is his name Yun...
-Yes.

328
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,124
My mother said his name is Yun Seong-jun.

329
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,387
I was right.

330
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:03,103
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

331
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,982
There he is.

332
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,785
Habaek.

333
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,496
I found him.

334
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,597
We did this. An amusement park.
Right, we've been to one.

335
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,181
A claw machine...

336
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,391
No, no way.

337
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,185
Yongyong will be jealous. Right?

338
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,940
And having street food.

339
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,859
Street food.

340
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,321
And visiting a video arcade.
He would love it.

341
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,907
I'll also ask him to get me a flower.

342
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,161
He'll buy me one, right?

343
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,495
What if he doesn't want to?

344
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,081
Sharing a bowl of shaved ice.

345
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,126
Taking a nap by the Han River.
I mustn't forget to bring a mat.

346
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,129
Sharing earphones
while listening to music together.

347
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,300
We have so many things to do.

348
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,219
We should have started early.

349
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,805
So-a.

350
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,267
Hey. Let's get moving.

351
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,393
We have so much to do.

352
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,230
By the way, you were right.

353
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,691
I'll look for my dad.

354
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,987
Since I'm not a kid anymore,
I shouldn't be so immature.

355
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,532
I'll find him
and make him apologize to me.

356
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,242
I'll be brave.

357
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:42,911
So-a.

358
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,581
-I have to step out.
-What?

359
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,459
Where are you going?

360
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,878
We don't have much time.

361
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,089
I'll be quick.

362
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,425
All right. Then I'll get all dolled up
and wait for you.

363
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,439
I'll dress up every day.

364
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,900
It's important.

365
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,779
I should underline it.

366
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,993
<i>But I remember him saying that day</i>

367
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,329
<i>that there's someone</i>
<i>he really has to meet.</i>

368
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,039
<i>His daughter.</i>

369
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:32,377
I can't ask my father's opinion
for a certain reason.

370
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,795
As for my mom...

371
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,510
My mom is dead,
so I can't ask her opinion either.

372
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,691
<i>Let me ask you a favor.</i>

373
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:59,320
Don't do anything even if you find out
who Yun Seong-jun is.

374
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,241
That knot has to be untied
by someone else.

375
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,996
In this lifetime,
there is nothing prepared for you.

376
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,672
-Ms. Yun.
-Hello, Mr. Shin.

377
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,507
Can we meet now?

378
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,842
Sorry?

379
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,177
<i>It won't take long.</i>

380
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:30,268
Over there.
That man, Yun Seong-jun, is in there.

381
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,854
So is my tablet.

382
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,065
You said she jumped into the river
and somehow came out alive.

383
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,026
Her father must've helped her.

384
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,362
<i>Have you tried to look for him?</i>

385
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,781
No, I haven't.

386
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,075
What if I do and find him here in Korea?

387
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,080
If he never visited us, even though
he's been here the whole time...

388
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,875
then what should I do?

389
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,752
How do you feel now?

390
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,341
Is that really your wish?

391
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,594
Meeting your dad and telling him
everything you've wanted to say to him?

392
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,559
I think so.

393
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,693
I'll...

394
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,571
get him out.

395
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,652
Why did you want to meet today?

396
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,780
I think...

397
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,201
-this will be our last session.
-Sorry?

398
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll tell you about the rest...

399
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,872
of my past.

400
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,584
<i>That night...</i>

401
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,129
<i>I chased a light.</i>

402
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,144
Are you okay?

403
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,197
It's okay. You're okay now.

404
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,368
Stay still. Calm down.

405
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,871
<i>It was the first time I ever felt...</i>

406
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,248
<i>the warmth of a human body.</i>

407
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,335
It was also the first time I learned...

408
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,172
the power of
hearing someone telling you...

409
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,092
that you're okay.

410
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,804
I said I was lucky.

411
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,809
Had he not been the first person
I met that night...

412
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,523
Had I met someone
who couldn't tell me that I was okay...

413
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,194
and embrace me...

414
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,615
what would I have become?

415
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,456
I have met three gods so far.

416
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,377
That man, my stepmother, and...

417
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,047
you.

418
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,512
Would you allow me
to thank you with a handshake?

419
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,429
You're back.

420
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,931
I hung our portrait.

421
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,100
Is it raining outside?

422
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,234
What's wrong?

423
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,070
You look like you're about to cry.

424
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,283
What is it?

425
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,369
What happened?

426
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,623
Tell me.

427
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,002
Did your friends refuse
to lend you money again?

428
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,548
We don't need it.

429
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,554
Your father...

430
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,474
I found him.

431
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,656
I...

432
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,660
found him.

433
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,000
Where? Where is he right now?

434
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,296
Come on.

435
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,965
Where is he?

436
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,637
In the river...

437
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,683
you jumped into that night.

438
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,063
What did you say?

439
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,485
What are you talking about?

440
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,196
What is that supposed to mean?

441
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,908
He came back...

442
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,912
to Korea that day.

443
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,083
He heard about your mother's death,
and he found Judong's tablet...

444
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,919
on his way to her grave.

445
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,004
The tablet...

446
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,968
has the power to realize
divine servants' wishes.

447
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,806
Seeing you must have been...

448
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,017
your father's wish that night.

449
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,741
That night...

450
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,912
right before you jumped into the river...

451
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,251
the power of the tablet...

452
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,421
led him there.

453
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,133
No.

454
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,761
He probably...

455
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,432
saw you jumping into the water.

456
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,269
No...

457
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,396
No.

458
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,773
No.

459
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,156
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

460
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:57,924
So-a.

461
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,425
So-a...

462
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,513
So-a! No!

463
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,932
So-a!

464
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,102
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

465
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,682
My dad...

466
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,230
can't swim.

467
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,112
He can't swim at all.

468
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,205
Why...

469
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,125
Why?

470
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,086
Why does this have to happen to me?

471
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,880
Dad...

472
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,260
Dad...

473
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,098
Dad, come out of there! Please, Dad!

474
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,809
Dad!

475
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,362
Please save my dad.

476
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,324
This doesn't make any sense.

477
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,242
My dad...

478
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,121
My dad can't die like this.

479
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:03,878
Habaek.

480
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,380
Please save my dad.

481
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,049
You're a god.

482
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,845
Bring my dad back to life, please.

483
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,474
I can't...

484
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,853
bring the dead back to life.

485
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,939
I had no idea.

486
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,153
I thought I got out of the water
on my own.

487
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,866
I feel so horrible for my dad.

488
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,786
My dad...

489
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,079
Because of me...

490
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,874
-No.
-It's all my fault.

491
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,211
It happened because of me.

492
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,295
I...

493
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,382
-I killed my dad. I did it.
-That's not true.

494
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,677
I killed him!

495
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,012
After doing that...

496
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,891
I spent all those years...

497
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,602
resenting and hating him.

498
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,647
I killed my dad. It was my doing!

499
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,026
No.

500
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,030
That's why he's not coming out.

501
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,951
He doesn't want to see me.

502
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,246
No. That's not true, So-a.

503
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,414
No.

504
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,753
I should go there.

505
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,588
Dad must be waiting for me.

506
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,091
I'll go bring him.

507
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,301
-No.
-Let go!

508
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,844
I can do it.

509
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,138
I used to be a good swimmer.

510
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,015
My dad knows that.

511
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,394
That's why he's waiting for me. Please.

512
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,479
-No, you can't go.
-Let go of me.

513
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,652
No, I can't let you do that. Please.

514
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,257
The body wouldn't move?

515
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,552
Habaek tried his best,
but it didn't even budge.

516
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,680
But, thankfully, the body is kept intact
because of the tablet.

517
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,850
He just left the tablet there
as removing it might ruin the body.

518
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,686
What's Ms. Descendant going to do now?

519
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,979
Why is it stuck there?

520
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,606
That's...

521
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,232
Nobody knows.

522
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,740
<i>What is a god?</i>

523
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,995
A superior being that grants humans
their most desperate wishes.

524
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,250
That is a true god.

525
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,130
<i>You said...</i>

526
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,593
your wish was to meet your father
and tell him everything.

527
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,097
I'm sorry I never got to make
that wish of yours come true.

528
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,226
I'm a god.

529
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,232
I'm sorry I couldn't even do that for you
as a god.

530
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,881
Excuse me, Lord Habaek.

531
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,229
-How's So-a?
-She's not doing well.

532
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,232
Mura and I also went in there,

533
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,318
-but we couldn't get him out either.
-Then what should we do?

534
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,655
Ms. Descendant has been waiting
for her father for such a long time.

535
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,281
She wants to...

536
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,742
go in there herself.

537
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,374
It's too deep for her.
We can't let her go in there.

538
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,917
But we can't just leave him there.

539
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,168
Why not?

540
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,842
Do nothing. Nothing at all.

541
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,553
-Just like back then.
-Mura.

542
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,097
Do you think I don't know
what you're trying to do?

543
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,266
I'm Mura.

544
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:36,186
I've always been able to read your mind
for the past 2,800 years.

545
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,607
I can tell how you feel
by just listening to your sigh.

546
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,943
-Mura.
-What are you talking about?

547
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,488
I know that you've decided
to use the power you need...

548
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,616
to return to our realm...

549
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,618
on her instead.

550
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,665
-Is she right?
-Lord Habaek.

551
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,166
You...

552
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,794
You can't do that.

553
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,131
The coronation ceremony won't be held
if you fail to go back.

554
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,384
If you fail to ascend the throne...

555
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,553
If that happens...

556
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,263
You'll perish.

557
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,308
You already know that.

558
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,649
I can't forgive you for even
thinking that. I won't allow it.

559
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,650
You can't, Habaek.

560
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,236
-Please don't, My Lord.
-You can't do that, Habaek.

561
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,290
I have to keep my promise.

562
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,750
Stop talking nonsense.

563
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,627
How is anything more important
than your life?

564
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,796
She said it's gods' duty
to protect humans.

565
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,346
How can I call myself a king...

566
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,852
if I can't even protect that woman?

567
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,187
Stop spouting total nonsense.

568
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,314
Do you think she'd really want that?

569
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,901
If you perish, you'll disappear
from the memories of humans.

570
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,028
She won't remember you at all.

571
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,322
She'll forget all about your existence.

572
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,877
What does this all mean?

573
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,572
-Listen to me.
-No.

574
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,908
I don't want to hear anything.

575
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,744
Please don't say anything.

576
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,497
How...

577
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,334
How could you think
about doing such a thing?

578
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,963
How could you think about doing
such a cruel thing to me?

579
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,049
You're going to die?

580
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,554
You're going to disappear from my memory?

581
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,183
I won't even know that you existed?

582
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,854
How can you...

583
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,941
-Listen to me.
-No...

584
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,072
It's because I did nothing for you.

585
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,200
I'm your god.

586
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,621
You said gods are beings that grant humans
their most desperate wishes.

587
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,959
So please give me a chance.

588
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,962
I never said anything like that.

589
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,842
I don't have any wishes.

590
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,765
And...

591
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,643
I told you that I'll protect you.

592
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:08,315
I never asked you to sacrifice your life
just to protect me.

593
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,861
Why are you so selfish?

594
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,752
What do we do? What should we do?
Let's just send him back, okay?

595
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,921
Isn't there a way to force him to go back?

596
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,298
Then what should we do?

597
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,218
He really might do it.

598
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,763
Let's lock him up. Yes, let's do that.

599
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,766
No, we can't force a king to do anything.

600
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,186
Then use your powers on her.
You can protect her. You guys are friends.

601
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,604
You already know that I can't.

602
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,525
It's something that simply can't be done
with the powers that the three of us have.

603
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,110
Then what do you suggest we do?

604
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,238
It's all your fault.

605
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,031
Why did you have to dig up the past?

606
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,535
If Habaek dies, I will kill you.

607
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,008
I heard Mura told you the other day...

608
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,803
that Habaek is nothing
if he fails to ascend the throne.

609
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,182
Habaek was born to be king

610
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,143
because that is his role.

611
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,354
If he doesn't ascend the throne,
he has no reason to exist.

612
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,398
That naturally means he'll perish.

613
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,151
That's the law of nature.

614
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,657
That's also why humans don't remember
all the gods that had existed in the past.

615
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,244
So, please do this for Habaek.

616
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,580
Tell him...

617
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:53,253
that you will just bury your father there.
Tell him you won't look for him anymore.

618
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:56,798
That is...

619
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,259
the only way you can both live.

620
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:14,774
<i>Lord Biryeom told me that</i>
<i>Ms. Descendant has decided to give up.</i>

621
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,476
So-a.

622
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,032
You're right.

623
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,495
I only thought about myself
because I was afraid to lose you.

624
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,872
I had said I'd help you

625
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,333
move on with your life
with the memories you have of me...

626
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,128
but I forgot about that.

627
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,674
So...

628
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,427
please promise me one thing.

629
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,847
Promise me...

630
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,017
that you'll cherish your life.

631
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,941
Promise me you'll do that...

632
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,194
even after I leave.

633
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,658
I'm sure your father...

634
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,786
is resting in peace now.

635
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,957
I'll always look after him.

636
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,502
Don't forget...

637
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,047
that I'm the God of Water...

638
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,050
and the King of the Land of Water.

639
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,527
Let's go...

640
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,071
see your father.

641
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,669
I'm sorry...

642
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,339
Dad.

643
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,886
I'm sorry.

644
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,102
I'm sorry, Dad.

645
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:01,775
What?

646
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,415
Where did he go?

647
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,585
Why is it so quiet here?

648
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,719
Don't worry.

649
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,269
You're the one who should leave
without any worries.

650
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,439
That was our initial plan, anyway.

651
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,026
Let's do what we had planned to do.

652
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,277
Where should we go first?

653
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,629
I love you.

654
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,887
What was that?

655
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,722
I give you my grace.

656
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,349
No, stop.

657
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,768
Therefore, you shall live, no matter what.

658
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,731
You shall never be unhappy.

659
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,152
And you shall live a full life.

660
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,571
No!

661
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,616
So...

662
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,122
I want you to meet someone you love...

663
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,836
and live happily
for the rest of your life.

664
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,380
Happiness.

665
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,676
That's what you've always wanted the most.

666
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,430
No, you can't do this.

667
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,477
Was this your plan from the get-go?

668
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,273
Were you fooling me all along?
Is that why you brought me here?

669
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,277
I can't just leave you
without doing anything.

670
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,905
I know that you'll go to your father...

671
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,282
after I leave.

672
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,285
How could I just leave knowing that?

673
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,748
I can do it. I can get him out of there.

674
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,502
What is this? How can you...

675
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,379
How can you be so foolish?

676
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,089
How?

677
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,800
What am I going to do now?

678
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,302
I'll tell you what you should do,
so listen up.

679
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,387
Get a hold of yourself...

680
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,766
and go meet your father right now.

681
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,310
No, I don't want to.

682
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,437
Hurry up.

683
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,648
He's waiting for you.

684
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:31,985
Hurry.

685
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,946
So-a.

686
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:37,782
Go.

687
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,494
Let me do something I can do for you...

688
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,206
while I'm still here.

689
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,472
No way.

690
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,433
I can't believe this.

691
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,602
Habaek, how can you do this to us?

692
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,686
Habaek.

693
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:13,693
Go.

694
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,363
-Your father is waiting for you.
-Habaek.

695
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,117
Leave them be.
Just let him do what he wants to do.

696
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,164
I can't believe this.

697
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,087
Go.

698
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,716
Your father is waiting for you.

699
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,460
<i>Dad.</i>

700
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,060
<i>Dad.</i>

701
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,771
<i>Dad.</i>

702
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,527
<i>Why are you here all alone?</i>

703
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,989
<i>You must've been so scared.</i>

704
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:28,411
<i>You must've been so lonely and cold.</i>

705
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,249
<i>Why didn't you call for me sooner?</i>

706
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,476
<i>Let's go home now, Dad.</i>

707
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,772
<i>Let's go home.</i>

708
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,979

Wait just a little while, Dad.

712
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,730
I'll bring Mom here soon.

713
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,316
You see...

714
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,986
I won't forgive you.

715
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:08,988
Okay.

716
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,407
I'm going to hate you...

717
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,076
and resent you.

718
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,080
Okay.

719
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,876
I'm going to regret...

720
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,006
meeting you.

721
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,176
Okay.

722
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,642
But before any of that happens...

723
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:42,396
I will put things back to normal.

724
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,077
I'll be sure...

725
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,247
to put everything back in its place.

726
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,583
What do you mean?

727
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,421
I thought she was dumb.

728
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:11,092
But I guess she's smart enough
to think of this.

729
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,556
However, I'm not going to forgive you
just because you thought of this.

730
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,016
What's going on?

731
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,644
Ms. Descendant has come up
with a solution.

732
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,730
She's going to use my tablet
that was inside Yun Seong-jun's pocket.

733
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:27,733
I heard that...

734
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,861
the tablet fulfills
a divine servant's deepest wish.

735
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:36,075
I'm going to help you return.

736
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,244
-So-a.
-Make it quick.

737
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,330
I'm trying so hard to hold back my urge
to kill you both.

738
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,792
Hurry up.
Mura might cause a flood any minute now.

739
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:56,971
Your hand, please.

740
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,112
Now...

741
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,825
everything will go back to normal.

742
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,128
-With the gods' grace--
-Everyone's here.

743
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,716
What? What's going on?

744
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,135
Is that the High Priest?

745
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,975
-What are you doing here?
-I come to the human world often.

746
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,144
Didn't Judong tell you?

747
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,271
What? Oh, I completely forgot.

748
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,525
I came down to catch a servant...

749
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,488
who ran away after causing trouble.

750
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,908
I also have to meet someone here.

751
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,162
You must be the one...

752
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,499
who got to live longer...

753
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,502
-thanks to the competent taxi driver.
-Pardon?

754
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,006
By any chance--

755
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,008
I heard you did a part-time job,
Lord Habaek.

756
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,761
It's not like you have parents
to give red long johns to.

757
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:24,225
I wonder what you did
with your first paycheck.

758
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,519
High Priest, were you...

759
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,272
What is this about?
Why must you interrupt us like this?

760
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:33,025
-Hurry up.
-Okay. With the gods' grace--

761
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,068
What are you doing?

762
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:36,070
Gosh, seriously.

763
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,948
Listen to me carefully.
I'm not going to repeat myself.

764
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:43,160
This fool used his remaining power
on this woman,

765
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,704
-which means he can't go back.
-Wait a second.

766
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,833
So you're going to use
the power of that tablet

767
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,793
on just helping Lord Habaek return?

768
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,921
Why would you waste
the precious power like that?

769
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,549
What do you mean, High Priest?

770
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,844
-If he fails to go back, he'll perish.
-Why would he fail to go back?

771
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,472
Lord Habaek has completed his mission.

772
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,058
That means he can return.

773
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,560
That's why he's a fool.

774
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,604
He should've just stayed there
when he first went back.

775
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:12,731
Wait.

776
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,364
My new mission was to find out...

777
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,577
the reason behind keeping
the sacred stones in the human world.

778
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,413
Oh, right.

779
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:31,876
That's correct. And from what I know,
you've already found the reason.

780
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:44,930
How could a god...

781
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,435
save the world...

782
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,815
if he can't even save
just one human being?

783
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:57,860
What does that mean?

784
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,153
I knew this would happen.

785
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,948
The universe favors Habaek so much.

786
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,284
Ms. Yun.

787
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:10,497
I advise you to use the tablet's power
on something more valuable.

788
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,960
I have a guest coming over,
so I have to go now.

789
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,129
Lord Habaek, don't forget

790
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,465
that you still have to return
to the Land of Water.

791
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,764
Yes, he's right.

792
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,600
Let's continue with what we were doing.

793
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,937
Make the best wish...

794
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,522
so that I can leave at ease.

795
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,443
Ask for more money
than Sheikh Mansour has.

796
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,992
With the gods' grace,
you shall be awakened.

797
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,459
You are the last descendant of
the family of divine servants,

798
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,128
and you shall now speak
of your deepest wish.

799
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,424
Don't hesitate. Just say it.

800
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,720
This is your chance to become happy
for the rest of your life.

801
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,396
My wish is...

802
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,316
My...

803
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,069
wish is...

804
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:25,906
I...

805
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,164
I wish...

806
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:39,420
you'd...

807
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,301
leave a little later.

808
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,474
Please stay by my side...

809
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,563
just until the day I die.

810
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,528
Please live with me until then.

811
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,282
You can go back...

812
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,535
and become a good king after I die.

813
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,376
Let's live together.

814
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,143
I'm leaving. I'm getting too angry.
I should get some rest.

815
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,404
You had the chance
to become richer than Mansour.

816
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,324
You gave that up
because you're still young.

817
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:06,965
I love you.

818
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,218
I love you.

819
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,856
You did a good deed,
so you'll be fine in your next life.

820
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,233
I didn't do anything.

821
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,694
Ms. Yun came to me and asked me
about the power of the tablet,

822
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,446
so I just told her what I knew.

823
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,866
You took the risk and revealed
the profound secret to her.

824
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:36,120
You told her
it's the strongest divine power.

825
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,373
Gosh, I've only just met you.

826
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:43,961
Nice to meet you. I am the High Priest.

827
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,173
My name is Shin Hu-ye.
I used to be the God of Fire.

828
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:53,053
Hu-ye, could you please teach me
how to use fire?

829
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,933
If I master that, I'll be able to control

830
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,686
water, fire, air, earth, and humans.

831
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,688
You should come see me soon.

832
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,745
Lord Habaek, let's go now.

833
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:23,250
That sly old man.

834
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,878
He knew everything all along.

835
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,467
I still have to return
to the Land of Water.

836
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:35,387
I'll go there and make sure
your wish can come true.

837
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,890
You'll be back, right?

838
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,100
Yes, I promise.

839
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,102
You'll be back soon, right?

840
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,313
Yes.

841
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:53,989
See you soon.

842
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:33,654
I organized them into categories.

843
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,364
There's no need for that.

844
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:36,949
I've figured out...

845
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,284
how to become a better person.

846
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:47,709
As you know, I used to get
such good grades in school.

847
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,421
I'm saying I've finally figured out
what you've been trying to tell me.

848
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:54,800
So what is it?

849
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,843
How will you become a better person?

850
01:15:58,845 --> 01:15:59,888
Go through this.

851
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,474
It's a proposal. I'll pester Grandpa
to start this new foundation.

852
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,185
This one is for single moms.

853
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:09,231
This is for the elderly who live alone,
and this is for children without parents.

854
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,817
Noblesse oblige.
That's how I'll become a better person.

855
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,241
It's not a bad idea,

856
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,493
but you should do this first.

857
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,121
Write down the names of the people here

858
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:25,706
and get them to sign this.

859
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,916
"I'm sorry."
That's what you should start with.

860
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,628
-What people?
-Those whom you owe an apology.

861
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,423
List them here, apologize to them,
and get their signatures.

862
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,842
Start with your grandfather.
Then I'll preach at you again.

863
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:40,304
-What?
-When you're a better person,

864
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:42,723
-I might become your friend.
-What?

865
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,439
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

866
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:31,605
<i>No, don't even think about it.</i>

867
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,316
Even if you jump in there,

868
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,526
Habaek won't be able to show up
and save you.

869
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,861
That's not what I was thinking.

870
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,033
Your dad is in the forest.
Why are you looking all sad here?

871
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,285
And don't throw things like that
in the river.

872
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:46,787
You'll pollute the water.

873
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,039
I have news for you.

874
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,126
Habaek won't be able to come back.

875
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:55,170
What do you mean?

876
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,214
Did a messenger come?

877
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,717
There's no need for a messenger.
I'm a goddess.

878
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,386
That's the feeling I'm getting.

879
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,097
Let's go.

880
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,187
No one's heard from him.
That means he's not coming back.

881
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:15,440
Stop worrying.
Let's just mind our business.

882
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,317
You really didn't like any of the rings?

883
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,362
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

884
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:27,285
Do you want to tell me something?

885
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,372
I've been meaning to tell you this.

886
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,040
Well...

887
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,210
I think I should marry Hyeong-sik.

888
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,087
-What?
-We should just get married.

889
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,005
Love isn't about anything special.

890
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,425
It just makes you want to care for
and look after the person.

891
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,677
For me, that's enough.

892
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:48,098
Hey, try to think rationally.

893
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:50,142
You can't marry your friend.

894
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,894
We've known each other for a long time,
so we know each other's flaws.

895
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:56,148
-Do you not like Hyeong-sik?
-No, that's not what I'm saying.

896
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,441
-Hyeong-sik is here.
-What?

897
01:18:57,524 --> 01:19:00,360
-To meet you in person.
-Hey, wait. Hey!

898
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,279
-Hey, wait!
-Hyeong-sik.

899
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,290
It's been a long time, So-a.

900
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,584
Yes, indeed.

901
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,878
How come you've never come by?

902
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:18,962
Because...

903
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,338
you scare me.

904
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,135
What did I do?

905
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,180
<i>Sang-yu is getting married?</i>

906
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:31,600
Yes. He doesn't even have
anything saved up.

907
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,018
I wanted to give him

908
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,021
enough money for a rent deposit
as a wedding gift when he gets married.

909
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,147
This is too sudden.

910
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,025
Gosh. I told him not to rush it,
but he won't listen to me.

911
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,527
He just keeps saying

912
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:45,155
people used to get married
with nothing but two spoons and a pot.

913
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,491
Things are so different nowadays,
you know.

914
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,750
<i>Hello? Did she hang up on me again?</i>
<i>Goodness.</i>

915
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,623
-I'm back.
-Yes.

916
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,917
I told you not to stay out late.
You never listen.

917
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,460
What took you so long?

918
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,588
The process for deferring the enthronement
was so complicated.

919
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,757
They're so inflexible.

920
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,365
Let's go eat something.

921
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:12,284
Okay.

922
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:29,050
-Will you continue to feel hunger?
-Yes.

923
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,136
What about the magic wand?

924
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:33,471
They said I can't take it.

925
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,182
Then... did you only bring
a driver's license again?

926
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:39,477
-They told me to get it here.
-Gosh, you have a lot to do.

927
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:41,104
Where's Namsuri?

928
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:42,814
He's sick of all the part-time jobs.

929
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,941
He's also scared of your friend,
so he didn't come.

930
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,235

931
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,339
Nothing has changed, right?

932
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:25,065
<i>People can survive anything</i>

933
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,525
<i>with the strength that they have.</i>

934
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,904
<i>But life would be better with love,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

935
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:33,114
