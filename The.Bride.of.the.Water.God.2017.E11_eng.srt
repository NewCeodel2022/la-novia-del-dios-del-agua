1
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

2
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,423
Mr. Shin...

3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,389
Ms. Yun.

4
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,814
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,060
Why are you here?

6
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,570
Stop!

7
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,086
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,929
I apologize.

9
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,271
Mr. Shin.

10
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,074
-What do you think you're doing?
-You're one to talk.

11
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,661
How could you punch him
without even knowing the situation?

12
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,246
"The situation"?

13
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,834
When I walked in, he was on top of you.
That's the situation I saw.

14
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,835
So what, then?

15
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,378
Are you saying...

16
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,674
I interrupted... your romantic rendezvous?

17
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,802
What did you say?

18
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,337
Did I...

19
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,839
interrupt something?

20
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,800
That's not something a god
who talks about dignity would say.

21
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,887
You talked about "the situation."

22
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,223
Tell me.

23
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,476
Did I interrupt something?

24
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,650
I don't want to explain.

25
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,320
Are you saying
I can think whatever I want?

26
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,990
Why are we even having this conversation?

27
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,659
Are we...

28
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,703
What are we?

29
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,025
Gosh, was that So-a? Why was she here?

30
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,444
She should've actually come by.

31
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,031
What did she do here?

32
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,910
And who was she with?

33
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,958
Even Sigmund Freud wouldn't be able
to interpret this.

34
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,228
So-a?

35
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,980
She really is here.

36
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,649
Did you come alone?

37
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,321
What happened?

38
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,158
Why did you get soaked in the rain?

39
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,661
Is something wrong?

40
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,540
Can I sleep at your place tonight?

41
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,209
What? Why?

42
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,086
I...

43
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,840
can't go home.

44
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,345
What happened?

45
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,578
<i>Is it done now? It's done.</i>

46
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,797
Did you have a bad dream?

47
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,134
<i>What made you contact me?</i>

48
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,470
Did something happen?

49
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,430
Was Biryeom here again?

50
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,100
No.

51
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,479
You told me that...

52
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,399
I didn't choose to be born
with such powers.

53
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,486
You said it's not my fault.

54
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,447
Do you remember that?

55
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,157
Yes.

56
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,035
Is it really not my fault?

57
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,038
What are you talking about?

58
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,250
Didn't you just say that...

59
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,963
because you were afraid of me?

60
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,801
If it wasn't my fault,

61
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,220
then who is responsible...

62
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,684
for all the deaths
that I caused back then?

63
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,565
You told me over and over again
that I didn't kill them.

64
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,609
I believed that.

65
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,736
But then who is responsible
for their deaths?

66
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,420
I'm sorry.

67
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,798
Ever since they showed up,

68
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,303
I've been losing my confidence.

69
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,019
I had forgotten...

70
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,440
who I once used to be,

71
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,696
but it's becoming clearer and clearer
these days.

72
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,492
It's all meaningless.

73
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,078
Yesterday,

74
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,084
I nearly killed that girl.

75
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,890
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH

76
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,975
Why is the door open?

77
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,480
Did she get here super early again?

78
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,984
They say you sleep less when you get old.
Why has she turned into an early riser?

79
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,404
Why are you so early today?

80
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,828
Who are you? Who...

81
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,623
Hey, neighbor! It's you.

82
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:53,963
Nurse Yu Sang-yu at Blessed Mental Health
is overexcited as always.

83
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,966
What are you doing here?

84
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,176
-I've been waiting.
-For whom?

85
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,722
For anyone.

86
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,223
How did you get in here?

87
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,683
And where is Dr. Yun?

88
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,017
What are you doing here?

89
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,978
Can you get us some tea?

90
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,480
Why did you follow me all the way here?

91
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,735
Why do you keep appearing in my dreams?
It's worrying me.

92
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,959
Sang-yu, you're distracting me. Sit down.

93
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,712
Why?

94
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,423
I know she met Mr. Shin last night.

95
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,176
Why did her neighbor spend the night
at her office?

96
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,844
What are you implying?

97
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,637
So-a was with me last night.

98
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,474
Exactly. The story doesn't add up.

99
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,517
You'll never make sense of this story.

100
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,937
She really shouldn't get involved
with that guy.

101
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,064
Personally, I'm against it too.

102
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,400
I should get going.

103
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,612
I thought you went home.

104
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,281
I was going to, but I couldn't.

105
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,366
So you waited for me?

106
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,620
I wasn't exactly waiting for you.

107
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,371
What?

108
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,290
I fell asleep
while trying to think of a way.

109
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,835
A way to do what?

110
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,921
A way to get out of here.

111
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,624
You couldn't leave
because you couldn't lock the door?

112
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,293
The kind of people I hate the most
are the irresponsible ones.

113
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,673
If I just took off,
what would happen to the door?

114
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,968
Should everyone only care about
their own feelings and needs?

115
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,888
Don't you think such an attitude
might hurt or harm others?

116
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,475
How can you be so selfish?

117
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,144
You should've at least given me your key
before you left.

118
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,277
If you're sorry, I'll let it go.

119
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,738
Thank you.

120
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,408
Let's go.

121
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,993
Can I be irresponsible?

122
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,764
If I become irresponsible...

123
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,393
In the end, I'll have no choice
but to be irresponsible.

124
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,983
So would it be okay to begin?

125
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,116
You asked me what we are.

126
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,953
I've come to hope...

127
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,834
that you'll always be untouched
and unharmed by misfortune.

128
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,465
You're not some distant sound
that will fade away.

129
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,011
I'm saying you're not
an insignificant, fleeting matter.

130
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,391
That is how I've come to think of you.

131
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,314
<i>I want to hold you in my arms...</i>

132
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,485
<i>and kiss you.</i>

133
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,949
<i>I want you to be my first and last.</i>

134
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,494
<i>I want my mind</i>
<i>to be filled with thoughts of you.</i>

135
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,706
<i>And when they overflow,</i>
<i>I want to just leave them be.</i>

136
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,127
I want my jealousy to be justified,

137
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,840
and I don't want to feel guilty,
even after punching someone.

138
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,683
But to do all of that,

139
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,228
I must begin.

140
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,774
Like you said,

141
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,486
the future that is laid out in front of us
won't change,

142
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,033
but may I still...

143
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,621
begin?

144
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,391
No.

145
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,812
You may not.

146
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,774
Don't begin anything.

147
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,878
Good morning.

148
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,307
When did you get back?

149
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,225
There are times when I envy humans.

150
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,353
I drank so much until the break of dawn,

151
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,025
but I was completely sober
on my way back here,

152
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,526
which was a little embarrassing.

153
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,361
I want to know
what it feels like to be drunk.

154
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,281
You see,

155
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,118
humans are such weak, inferior creatures.

156
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,329
How can they lack so many things?

157
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,583
But you know what? I envy that.

158
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,134
Look at this.

159
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,595
Things like this don't even impress you.

160
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,265
Because you don't lack anything,

161
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,351
there's nothing I can do for you.

162
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,855
Shall I delete all the mean comments
about you?

163
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,281
By the way, I'm having a hard time
getting used to seeing you

164
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,075
at my place every morning.

165
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,995
You do everything Habaek tells you to do.

166
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,039
You're free today, right?

167
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,707
What are you going to do all day?

168
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,252
I'm going to watch you.

169
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,840
That won't be easy.

170
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,011
-Hey, look.
-What is it?

171
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,513
-Isn't she Hye-ra?
-My gosh!

172
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,994
Excuse me.

173
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,335
Let's go.

174
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,807
NO PHOTOS FOUND

175
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,017
What just happened?

176
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,355
-It's Hye-ra.
-Hye-ra.

177
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,077
Does he provoke you like this too?

178
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,957
By the way, why do you never talk?

179
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,501
Did I actually freeze
and crush your tongue?

180
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,350
You know that I've been
very patient today, right?

181
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,936
I think I deserve a little reward for it,
so tell me.

182
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,605
Why do you seem so anxious these days?

183
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,899
I'm having so much fun
keeping you all curious.

184
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,818
Even if I end up telling everyone
in the world,

185
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,153
I'll never tell you.

186
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,155
Fine.

187
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,283
Then what is it
that you want from Mr. Shin?

188
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,910
Tell me that, at least.

189
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,166
Answer me. What do you want from him?

190
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,043
I want him to die.

191
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,893
Mr. Kim, please cancel
everything on my schedule.

192
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,729
I have to take care of something.

193
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,650
Then compensate them for all damages.

194
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,278
What?

195
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,406
Go find a job elsewhere
if that's what you want to do.

196
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,326
You're going to clear your schedule
and keep following me around?

197
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,454
I'm going to watch your every single move
from this moment on.

198
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:34,251
All right. Then I'll forget
about that guy, just for today.

199
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,391
<i>How about you just tell her everything</i>
<i>and ask her for help?</i>

200
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,898
What? Help with what?

201
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,527
You said you think
she saw your wound disappear.

202
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,446
I'm not sure, though.

203
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,907
Sure or not,
there's no reason for you to hide it.

204
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,784
I've told you before.

205
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,829
She'll be able to understand you
better than anyone else can.

206
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,756
Come in.

207
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,679
I didn't know you'd be here today.

208
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,139
What is happening?

209
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,688
About that psychiatrist...

210
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,814
Are you going to marry her?

211
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,567
What do you mean?

212
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,195
Does she have some major dirt on you
or something?

213
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,448
I just don't get it.

214
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,744
You're not the type to make
such an irresponsible decision.

215
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,038
We'll go with the site
in Chungcheong Province.

216
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,999
The assessment results show it's as good
as the Gangwon Province site.

217
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,502
Our partners in the UK
are also positive about it.

218
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,004
But I don't own any land in that province!

219
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,425
What I'm trying to say is...

220
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:11,264
I came here because I was just worried
that you might be in some kind of trouble.

221
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,183
Your mother took you in

222
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,852
and raised you with so much love.

223
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,063
When you started living with us...

224
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,774
I have to step out for a meeting.

225
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,026
Well...

226
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,655
All right.

227
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,616
In any case,

228
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,829
I think Gangwon Province will be
a lot better than Chungcheong Province.

229
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,456
Call me after you give it some thought.

230
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,792
I won't change my mind.

231
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,474
Mr. Min wasn't in his office earlier.

232
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,392
I'm here.

233
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,562
Keep it brief, please.

234
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,647
I'm leaving early.
Time is money for me right now.

235
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,483
-I'll give you that money.
-Two minutes have passed.

236
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,444
He's been making it so obvious
since hugging me.

237
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,945
What do you mean?

238
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,322
Mr. Shin is acting all cold toward me,

239
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,824
but it feels so unnatural.

240
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,411
Should I just let him know...

241
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,039
that he can treat me like he used to?

242
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,294
-Or should I not say anything?
-Don't say anything.

243
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,089
That'd probably be better
for your mental health.

244
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,307
<i>No.</i>

245
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,851
You may not.

246
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,313
Don't begin.

247
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,819
She turned me down.

248
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,033
A female human turned me down
for the first time in 2,800 years.

249
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,751
Does she even realize
who she just dared to turn down?

250
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,383
She wasn't just foolish, arrogant,

251
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:14,387
oblivious, and condescending.

252
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,476
She's a coward as well.

253
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,657
What's up? Why did you call me?

254
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,620
He wants to lose control and go wild.
That's my specialty.

255
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,497
That prick, he's finally growing on me.

256
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,500
I'll teach him 101 ways to do just that.

257
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,418
What is going on?

258
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,922
I mean, why? Why does he want
to lose control and go wild?

259
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,382
You don't have to come.

260
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,217
Had he needed you,
he would have called you.

261
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,344
He called me even though
he's not exactly fond of me.

262
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,972
Exactly. That's why this is so strange.

263
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,018
It's because I'm a guy.

264
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,646
Had Judong been around,
he would've called him instead.

265
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,065
In other words,
I'm just Judong's substitute.

266
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,819
-What do you mean?
-He needs some guy time.

267
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,906
I'll find out what happened, okay?

268
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,289
Practice those kissing scenes.

269
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,334
It'd be crazy for Aphrodite to turn
into Amazoness because she can't kiss.

270
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,007
Go to the powder room.
I've prepared everything you need.

271
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,593
No one else would do this for you.

272
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,262
It'll be just you and Habaek, right?

273
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,599
Tell me that you won't do anything bad.

274
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,936
-I should watch both of you.
-Okay, fine.

275
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,730
I heard you.

276
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,026
You know I always listen to you.

277
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,445
What are you guys going to do?

278
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,739
He wants to let loose and go wild
like humans do,

279
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,951
so I'll teach him the fastest
and most effective way to do just that.

280
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,163
It wouldn't work for me,
but it might for Habaek.

281
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,716
The powder room?

282
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,803
<i>Welcome. Are you surprised?</i>

283
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,849
-<i>Welcome. Are you surprised?</i>
-I will kill you.

284
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,518
<i>Welcome. Are you surprised?</i>

285
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,314
I rushed to buy this place, just for you.

286
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,232
We haven't seen each other for a while.

287
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,488
So, is this losing control?

288
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,574
Not really.

289
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,951
This is just a platform.

290
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:47,374
Once you go through this stage,
you'll automatically lose control.

291
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,505
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

292
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,596
Will this make me crawl on all fours?

293
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,390
Is that what you mean?

294
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,018
That might happen too.

295
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,855
Whatever you do, it'll be something
you'd never do when you're sober,

296
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,399
so don't be too embarrassed.

297
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,404
By the way, why did you want
to lose control and go wild today?

298
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,035
Why are you laughing?

299
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,373
I'm not sure whether or not I should
hint to you that I know something.

300
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,999
What do you know?

301
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,626
Are things not going so well?

302
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,047
What do you mean?

303
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,301
I thought So-a was good for nothing,

304
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,929
but she somehow managed to make you blush.

305
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,973
None of us would be able to do that.

306
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,144
I don't know what you're talking about.

307
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,649
Actually,

308
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,485
do you want to hear something about her
that you don't know?

309
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,114
I bet you had no idea.

310
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,994
My friend and I have some shared memories.

311
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,165
I know how So-a looked when she was 20,
which was way before you met her.

312
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,545
Is that so?

313
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,467
She looked like freesias in spring.

314
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,720
She liked to wear miniskirts
to show off her bare legs.

315
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,597
She was so bubbly.

316
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,391
From what I remember,
many guys had a crush on her.

317
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,311
And she went out with a few of them.

318
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,899
Actually, I think she was quite close
with a few of them.

319
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,276
There's more.

320
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,405
She refused the diamond ring I gave her
for an interesting reason.

321
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,911
She said if she took it, she would feel...

322
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,789
indebted to me for some odd reason.

323
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,672
Oh, my. I should record this.

324
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,265
Why are you here all alone?

325
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,226
-Look at that.
-Did you get turned down too?

326
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,269
I knew he'd discover his new self.

327
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,729
Did you get rejected too?

328
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:19,400
-Is she also a coward?
-That dude. He outdoes me in everything.

329
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,443
I admit it.

330
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,986
Do you want to be left alone?

331
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,780
I'll be off, then.

332
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,826
-Why are you here all alone?
-Jeez.

333
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,787
-Did you get turned down too?
-He's repeating it all over again.

334
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,747
-Did you get rejected too?
-He's too much.

335
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,123
Is she also...

336
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,836
Mister, what are you doing?

337
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,173
What's your opinion on it?

338
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,216
What are you doing?

339
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,262
How dare you touch me?

340
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,852
All the words I know
and even the words that I don't know

341
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,605
are trapped in time by the black tongue...

342
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,023
You look so serious.

343
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,484
Can you let us in
on what you're talking about?

344
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,824
I'm talking about the unhappiness
of all standing things.

345
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,330
Right, everyone is unhappy.

346
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,000
These guys are unhappy too.
It's not just him.

347
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,210
In that sense,
the world is a pretty fair place.

348
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,882
But I think you can make us happy
with just a little effort.

349
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,802
If you could just take your wallet
out of your pocket,

350
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,137
it'll make us pretty happy.

351
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,763
What do you say?

352
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,267
They seem to be having a good time.

353
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,311
I think...

354
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,607
that's such a stupid idea.

355
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:45,653
I hate it when someone calls me stupid.

356
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,282
What?

357
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,575
-Gosh.
-What the...

358
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,871
-You piece of...
-Hey, get him!

359
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,833
Today has been such an eventful day.

360
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,086
-How dare you!
-You prick!

361
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,173
-Come here, you little shit.
-Hey.

362
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,050
Oh, no.

363
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,012
-Watch the legs.
-He has ridiculously long legs.

364
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,932
If Mura saw this,
she'd definitely freeze some tongues.

365
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,156
Hey, get his legs. Hold those legs.

366
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,368
-Hold the legs!
-Those legs...

367
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,828
-Who's this guy?
-Jeez!

368
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,213
<i>Can I be irresponsible?</i>

369
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,763
<i>But to do all of that,</i>

370
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,807
<i>I must begin.</i>

371
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,059
<i>Like you said,</i>

372
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,020
<i>the future that is laid out in front of us</i>
<i>won't change,</i>

373
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,064
<i>but may I still...</i>

374
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,774
<i>begin?</i>

375
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,371
However much I think about it,
my answer is no.

376
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,584
Are you not calling it a day?

377
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,170
I was just about to leave.

378
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,317
<i>Sure or not,</i>
<i>there's no reason for you to hide it.</i>

379
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,112
<i>I've told you before.</i>

380
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,408
<i>She'll be able to understand you</i>
<i>better than anyone else can.</i>

381
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,246
Why are you hesitating?
You don't think she's worth it?

382
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,831
It's not that.

383
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,459
<i>She's more than worth it.</i>

384
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,004
<i>She'll become the first</i>
<i>and strongest desire I've ever had</i>

385
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,090
<i>since my life in this world began.</i>

386
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,884
<i>Of course I'll win her heart</i>
<i>by fair means.</i>

387
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,595
<i>I heard all you can do</i>
<i>is destroy people and things.</i>

388
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:28,107
<i>Does someone like me</i>
<i>deserve a woman like her?</i>

389
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,818
Hello?

390
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,446
<i>Ms. Descendant,</i>
<i>Lord Habaek isn't picking up.</i>

391
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,281
<i>I don't think I can go home tonight.</i>

392
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,532
<i>I have a night shift.</i>

393
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,452
There are people
who ride the duck boat this late at night?

394
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,912
That shift is done,

395
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,331
but the owner of the fried chicken place
asked me for help.

396
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,045
I'm getting paid more
because it's a night shift.

397
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,755
All right, I'll let him know.

398
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,632
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

399
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,258
Hello?

400
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,135
Hello?

401
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,352
Hello?

402
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,271
Ms. Yun.

403
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,732
Yes, Mr. Shin.

404
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,193
Did I catch you...

405
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,153
at a good time?

406
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,364
Yes, we can talk.

407
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,327
Did you get home safely last night?

408
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,871
Nothing happened, right?

409
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,790
How are you feeling?

410
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,211
I'm sorry.

411
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,631
I should've called you first.

412
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,882
All is well.

413
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,303
-I'm fine.
-I'm really sorry.

414
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,014
I should've been more thoughtful
as your psychiatrist.

415
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,266
It's okay.

416
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,268
Well...

417
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,270
About that guy last night...

418
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,897
I can't explain in detail,

419
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,108
but I think there was a misunderstanding.

420
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,611
He asked me to tell you that he's sorry.

421
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,155
<i>I should've told you sooner.</i>

422
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,531
I see.

423
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,908
I'll book you in again for Monday.

424
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,785
That works for you, right?

425
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,538
Of course.

426
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,499
Then how about we start
the sessions for your employees

427
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,209
this coming Wednesday?

428
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,335
Sure, let's do that.

429
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,880
Don't you have to go back
to the farm soon to do more work?

430
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,757
I'll have to see.

431
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,679
All right. You should get some rest
at the weekend.

432
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,473
You looked very tired yesterday.

433
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,019
I will.

434
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,688
I have to go.

435
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,773
<i>Okay, I'll see you on Monday.</i>

436
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,914
You really don't have to do this.

437
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,749
Why do you work
all the part-time gigs alone?

438
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,459
Does the water god do nothing?

439
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,545
Sorry? How dare you utter
such a blasphemous remark?

440
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,090
I just thought those in your world
might think differently.

441
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,009
You don't have other part-time jobs?

442
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,261
I don't have a government-issued ID,

443
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,389
-so it's hard to get jobs.
-Oh, I see.

444
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,602
By the way, from what happened
to So-a to what the beggar...

445
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,313
I mean, you know how the voracious god
cursed the water god,

446
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,482
a kiss is mandatory, right?

447
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,733
-Pardon?
-What I'm saying is,

448
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:19,904
when gods use their powers on someone,
it has to be done mouth-to-mouth, right?

449
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,656
There must be no other way.

450
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,537
Well, I wasn't suggesting
we do something now!

451
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,089
You sort it out yourself.
You won't let me in anyway.

452
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,424
Gosh, did he drink?

453
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,426
How much did he drink?

454
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,471
By the way, did you ever crawl
on all fours when you were drunk?

455
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,098
What?

456
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,725
You didn't pole dance, did you?

457
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,271
I told him that you're the innocent,
ladylike type, just in case.

458
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,816
I'm off.

459
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,283
What?

460
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,368
If I must ask a favor of you...

461
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,496
should I ask you to make him stay

462
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,206
or let him go?

463
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,711
I can't figure out
how I really feel about it.

464
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,005
What?

465
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,842
I should book a session with you
one of these days.

466
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,768
Hold on.

467
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,369
Wake up, please.

468
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,419
Namsuri isn't back yet.

469
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,422
Stay here for now.

470
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,299
Wait for him here.

471
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,509
As soon as he's back,

472
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,012
I'll tell him to take you.

473
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,555
Gosh!

474
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:36,874
I'm exhausted.

475
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,357
Let's just stay like this.

476
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,365
I won't begin...

477
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,329
so don't be afraid.

478
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,585
Let's just...

479
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,341
stay like this for a few minutes.

480
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,866
<i>Why are you here all alone?</i>

481
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,493
<i>Did you get turned down too?</i>

482
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,954
<i>Did you get rejected by a girl too?</i>

483
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,164
<i>Is she also a coward?</i>

484
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,416
It's a rare video,
so I'd better keep it safe.

485
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,922
I can't believe he's become such a wreck.

486
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,715
He was always a handful.

487
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,218
He can be small-minded and petty at times.

488
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,803
Sometimes, he can even be cowardly.

489
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,180
And to be frank,
he's half-human right now.

490
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,307
He might even fart, you know.

491
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,434
-You did this on purpose, didn't you?
-No.

492
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,603
I was curious, and I've learned
he really gets drunk.

493
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,772
I've always wanted to experience it.

494
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,692
He's making me jealous
in all kinds of ways.

495
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,319
What's wrong with him?

496
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,737
What the heck is going on?

497
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:56,949
Tell me.

498
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,495
Why the hell is he staying here
instead of going back?

499
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,001
Stop worrying about him.
He's just seeing what it's like.

500
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,712
He feels pressured because
he'll ascend the throne soon.

501
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,088
And once that happens,

502
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,674
he won't be able to enjoy
this kind of freedom.

503
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,594
That's why he has a lot on his mind now.

504
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,387
Really?

505
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,311
Why did he become so weak?
It doesn't suit him at all.

506
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,522
Does the water here not agree with him?

507
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:35,404
Should I get him some herbal medicine,
the kind that humans take?

508
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,041
Why are you standing there like that?

509
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,057
It'll be another hot day.

510
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,942
Do you want a glass of the fruit juice?

511
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,197
I noticed that there are a lot of books
in this house.

512
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,867
-They're all books about traveling.
-Traveling?

513
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,869
I used to only read travel books

514
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,080
because I wanted
to get out of this country.

515
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,624
But I haven't read that one yet.

516
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,251
<i>IF THERE'S A WORD MORE POWERFUL THAN LOVE</i>

517
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:19,258
The sun's out, so I should hang
the clean laundry on the rooftop.

518
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,023
Let's eat after I finish hanging these up.

519
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,574
Can you read it out loud for me?
Just the first sentence.

520
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,827
Usually, the first sentence of the book

521
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,747
tells me whether or not
I should read the rest.

522
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,834
"All humans are stars.

523
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,796
Flowers have bloomed
on every abandoned island."

524
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,426
If a book starts like that,
I can read it all night long.

525
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,646
I asked you to read it out loud.

526
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,398
Why are you reading it silently?
You're mean.

527
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,400
-Don't mind me.
-What?

528
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,569
You can't even read
the first sentence aloud for me?

529
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,364
I'll tell you to stop reading
if I don't like what I hear.

530
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,036
I know it's embarrassing
to read something out loud.

531
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,662
"How...

532
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,998
did we meet?

533
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,962
One day, a butterfly flew like a petal

534
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,089
<i>and made a small flutter.</i>

535
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,137
<i>How did we meet and end up here?</i>

536
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:53,519
<i>The corner of the street where</i>
<i>we exchanged our love on one spring day.</i>

537
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,396
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

538
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,026
<i>We slowly held hands</i>
<i>as we walked down the street together.</i>

539
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:09,201
<i>The dandelions beneath the telephone pole</i>
<i>swayed brightly.</i>

540
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:16,375
<i>How did we manage</i>
<i>to come this far together?</i>

541
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,504
Were we able to reach love
because we walked through

542
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,965
such lovely moments together?

543
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,011
I've come to believe that there is
no such thing as coincidence in love.

544
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,597
I've come to trust
that the universe calculates

545
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,142
even the littlest things
such as the wing stroke of a butterfly

546
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,061
in order to make two people fall in love.

547
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,439
An inevitable miracle.

548
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,693
I suppose I didn't want to...

549
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,196
think that we met by a mere coincidence.

550
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,077
So, the only thing I can do...

551
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,582
-is do my best..."
-I like it.

552
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,255
You can stop reading. Let's go eat now.

553
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,091
I'll read the rest myself.

554
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,151
<i>IF THERE'S A WORD MORE POWERFUL THAN LOVE</i>

555
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,521
Oh, boy.

556
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,025
-Is this edible?
-I did my best.

557
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,694
-Where's Namsuri?
-He'll be here soon.

558
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,247
Is it good?

559
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,249
Not really.

560
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:30,300
Why did you wear miniskirts
and show off your bare legs?

561
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,427
-What?
-Back in the day.

562
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:36,181
I heard you used to look like
freesias in springtime.

563
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,475
Why don't you look like that anymore?

564
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,650
<i>I told him that you're the innocent,</i>
<i>ladylike type, just in case.</i>

565
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,862
I also heard you dated quite a few guys.

566
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,949
Did you always have a knack
for seducing men?

567
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,493
Do you still keep in touch with them?

568
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,704
Excuse me.

569
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,416
You shouldn't talk with food
in your mouth.

570
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,003
What about you?

571
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,963
I'm sure you've dated countless women

572
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,923
in the past 2,800 years.

573
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,676
Who did you like the most
out of all your exes?

574
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,511
Who?

575
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,388
Tell me.

576
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,147
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?
You must've liked her a lot.

577
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,025
-I'll pretend I'm not curious anymore.
-Thanks.

578
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,319
I would've repaid you
if I'd had my powers.

579
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,072
What would you have done for me?

580
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,535
You're a woman of many flaws,
so I'll help you fix them.

581
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,912
I'll make sure you can swim

582
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,914
and gulp down cold water
without any problems.

583
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,459
I'll fix those things on my own.

584
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,628
Be a bit more daring
since it's just your imagination anyway.

585
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,338
What do you want?

586
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,508
-Become like Sheikh Mansour?
-That'd be nice too.

587
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,177
You can do a lot of things.

588
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,972
First, turn my land into a gold field.

589
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,350
And please1
let oil come out of the East Sea.

590
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,144
I'll be the owner of that oil field.

591
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,772
And I'd love it if the two Koreas
could become one again.

592
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,148
After that, you can build a house

593
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,484
that looks like a Greek temple
on the beach in Vanuatu.

594
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,444
And change my looks as well
if that's possible.

595
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,780
I'd love to look like
a tall, voluptuous Greek goddess.

596
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,533
<i>Today, I'm having breakfast</i>
<i>at the White House.</i>

597
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,577
<i>Meeting the president</i>
<i>would be too much for me,</i>

598
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,496
<i>so I'll just meet the members</i>
<i>of the shadow cabinet.</i>

599
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,956
<i>In the afternoon,</i>
<i>I'll fly to London on my private jet.</i>

600
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,085
<i>I have to attend</i>
<i>an opening party at the Saatchi Gallery</i>

601
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,961
<i>because I'm a world-famous celebrity.</i>

602
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,463
<i>I have to go to New York after that.</i>

603
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,507
<i>Jude Law wants to meet up</i>
<i>for coffee and catch-up.</i>

604
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,383
<i>I'll go shopping in SoHo,</i>

605
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,260
<i>and I'm going to stay at</i>
<i>the Four Seasons Hotel</i>

606
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,762
<i>in their presidential suite.</i>

607
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,306
<i>If I get too tired, I'll just head</i>
<i>straight back to Vanuatu.</i>

608
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,433
<i>I'll tell Jude Law</i>
<i>that we'll have to meet next time.</i>

609
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,437
That's the kind of life I want.

610
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,025
What? Where did he go?

611
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,325
-What are you doing?
<i>-</i>I couldn't really understand any of it,

612
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,411
but it was making me cringe so much
that I couldn't keep listening.

613
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,163
Having these human senses

614
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,331
is quite annoying.

615
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,168
A king must know

616
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,587
how to listen to his people.

617
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,512
How about some iced coffee for dessert?

618
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,014
Sure.

619
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,893
Let's make ourselves a simple drink.

620
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,605
Things would've been different
if you'd had the servant's tablet.

621
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,440
"The servant's tablet"?

622
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,986
The proof that my family
pledged to serve the gods?

623
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,780
It has the power to fulfill
the servant's wish.

624
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,033
It's a small token of gratitude
from the gods.

625
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,326
Then give it to me.

626
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,786
I lost it.

627
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:49,040
Jeez, you're just never helpful.

628
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,589
Why bother telling me about it, then?

629
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:06,600
My ex-boyfriend also loved iced coffee.

630
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,526
You shouldn't have lost that tablet.

631
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,237
Then you could've granted me my wish.

632
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,156
I wouldn't have been able
to understand what wish.

633
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,826
Why not? Do I have to speak
in some kind of special language?

634
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,746
It has to be a real wish.

635
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,497
Something that you truly want.

636
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,500
-Just one wish.
-Just one?

637
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,337
From what I know,
your wish isn't to become filthy rich.

638
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,132
I'm home.

639
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,719
You're back.

640
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,679
You must be hungry. Come to the kitchen.

641
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,687
Was everything okay?

642
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,856
I couldn't focus on work
because I was worried,

643
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,566
knowing you'd be alone all night.

644
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,401
-Namsuri.
-Yes?

645
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,527
Go eat your food.

646
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,196
Okay.

647
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,532
I earned a lot of money.

648
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,994
Tell me if there's anything
you want to eat or read.

649
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,997
-There's nothing.
-Okay. Then I'll take care of everything.

650
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,422
Have a seat.

651
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,175
I haven't finished my meal yet.

652
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,054
-You must be exhausted.
-No, I'm all right.

653
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,725
But I almost engaged
in some degrading behavior.

654
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,231
What a cute cup.

655
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,401
Mr. Nature worked part-time
and got it for me as a gift.

656
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,568
What?

657
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,696
What's wrong?

658
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:48,159
Did Lord Habaek really work
and buy this for you himself?

659
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,327
Yes.

660
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,087
Wait, Namsuri.

661
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,757
What's wrong with him?

662
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,592
It's probably because he's very tired.

663
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,682
Sleep after you eat.
It won't be good when it's cold.

664
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,816
Where are you going?

665
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,535
What's the matter with him?

666
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,205
The heat must be getting to him.

667
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,140
Do you want to go to the beach?

668
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,350
What?

669
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,894
You don't turn into a mermaid
when you enter the sea, do you?

670
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,145
The sea?

671
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,856
Look up "Picnic lunch boxes"
on the Internet,

672
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,691
and you'll find what you need to prepare.

673
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,360
-You want me to do it?
-You don't want to?

674
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,154
Then we'll just take
the leftover kimchi fried rice.

675
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,534
"Picnic lunch boxes."

676
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,210
So, what do we need to buy?

677
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,295
Avocados, salmon, abalone,

678
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,715
-eel, mushrooms, and short ribs.
-What's gotten into you?

679
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,342
What?

680
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,302
What?

681
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,932
You said we're making lunch for a picnic.

682
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,559
Exactly. People usually make <i>gimbap</i>
when they go on a picnic.

683
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,522
What?

684
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,233
Why are you upset?

685
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,485
Gosh, that guy...

686
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,096
It'll burst open in your mouth anyway.

687
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,409
<i>Who is this?</i>

688
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,413
It's me. I'm going for lunch with Biryeom.
You should join us.

689
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:41,708
-I'm busy.
-<i>I saw you going all crazy last night.</i>

690
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,501
I shouldn't leave you alone.

691
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,004
I can't go anywhere
as I have to keep an eye on Biryeom,

692
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,297
so you should move in here too.

693
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,299
-I'm going to the beach.
-What?

694
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,051
-What did you say?
-I'm making <i>gimbap.</i>

695
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,137
I'll check it out first and take you there
if it's nice.

696
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,889
We're not taking that broken gimbap.

697
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,265
I have to go.

698
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,352
Have some class, will you?

699
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,277
"Broken<i> gimbap"?</i>

700
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,074
Is he not coming?

701
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,953
He says he's making <i>gimbap</i>
to go to the beach. What does that mean?

702
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,371
What?

703
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,131
I have to say, I'm slowly starting
to grow fond of that dude.

704
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,927
I'll go get changed. Let's go boxing.

705
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,223
I can't believe this. <i>Gimbap?</i>

706
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,558
Has he really lost his mind or something?

707
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,570
<i>Why are you here all alone?</i>

708
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,113
<i>Did you get turned down too?</i>

709
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,491
<i>Did you get rejected by a girl too?</i>

710
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,410
<i>Is she also a coward?</i>

711
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,428
I haven't seen this one.

712
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,748
<i>If I could...</i>

713
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,461
<i>I'd really love to...</i>

714
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,427
<i>live with her.</i>

715
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,567
<i>Here in this world.</i>

716
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,569
Habaek!

717
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,621
Where did she go?

718
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,101
<i>The person you are trying to reach</i>
<i>is unavailable. Please leave a message.</i>

719
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,853
-He's not picking up?
-No.

720
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,357
That must be him.

721
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,026
Namsuri, let's go to--

722
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,698
What brings you here?

723
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,245
Do you know why
a lowly human being like you

724
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,706
is allowed to talk to us
and be honored by our presence?

725
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,960
If you find out that
it was all because of your ancestor...

726
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,879
Mura, what are you doing?

727
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,298
...I wonder if you'll still be able
to stay by Habaek's side.

728
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,716
Mura!

729
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,094
Shall I tell you
why your ancestor ended up...

730
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,804
becoming a divine servant?

731
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,014
Stop.

732
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,183
Mura!

733
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:28,976
Mura!

734
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,762
<i>-Do whatever it takes to persuade him.</i>
<i>-I heard you did nothing.</i>

735
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,056
<i>If he doesn't ascend the throne,</i>
<i>he'll be nothing.</i>

736
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,560
<i>-What is it that you really want to say?</i>
<i>-I beg you. Please don't hold him back.</i>

737
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,020
<i>I bluffed that I'd protect you.</i>

738
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,440
<i>I admitted in front of her</i>
<i>that he's in love with her.</i>

739
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,608
<i>Why did I make a promise</i>
<i>that I cannot keep?</i>

740
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,444
<i>-I want to ask you if I can leave...</i>
<i>-Go back.</i>

741
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,904
<i>I've realized</i>
<i>that you truly want me to leave.</i>

742
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,365
<i>Return to where you belong.</i>
<i>Please go back.</i>

743
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,159
<i>Let's just part ways here.</i>

744
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,869
<i>Goodbye.</i>

745
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,203
<i>Farewell.</i>
