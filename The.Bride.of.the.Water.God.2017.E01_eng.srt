1
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,327
What do you see?

2
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,664
-Is a bird flying in the sky?
-That's right.

3
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,460
It flew over to the other side of the sun.
Where did it go?

4
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,420
It must've gone to the other world.

5
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,547
Can't you see? Take a good look.

6
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,841
I can't see it.

7
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,469
-Shall I help you see it?
-Yes.

8
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,678
All right.

9
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,097
Have a good look.

10
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,352
The world we're living in
consists of the part where we reside

11
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,979
and the other part over there.

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,731
This is where we live,

13
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,984
and the gods live in the other part
of the world.

14
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,277
"The gods"?

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,408
<i>The world of the gods</i>
<i>consists of the Land of Water,</i>

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,079
<i>the Land of the Sky,</i>
<i>and the Land of Earth.</i>

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,415
<i>They send deities to our world</i>

18
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,502
<i>to look after and protect</i>
<i>nature in the human realm.</i>

19
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,547
Do they look after humans too?

20
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,008
Human beings will figure things out
on their own.

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,887
<i>The Kings of the Land of Water,</i>
<i>Land of the Sky, and Land of Earth</i>

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,015
<i>were born with the fate</i>
<i>of becoming rulers.</i>

23
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>The King of the Land of Water,</i>
<i>from where all things originate,</i>

24
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,273
<i>is given absolute authority</i>
<i>which makes him the King of the Kings.</i>

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,361
<i>In order to ascend to the throne,</i>
<i>they must make their royal seals</i>

26
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,822
<i>with the sacred stone</i>
<i>that has a holy messageÂ engraved on it,</i>

27
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,284
<i>but that stone is kept by the gods</i>
<i>who reside in the human world.</i>

28
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,328
<i>That means they have to come here</i>
<i>and get the stone</i>

29
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,497
if they wish to become
the ruler of the divine world.

30
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,290
That's correct.

31
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,544
But what if those deities refuse
to give it to them?

32
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,672
Only humans do things like that.

33
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,800
But there's something I don't understand.

34
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,846
Why is the sacred stone
kept in the human world?

35
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,859
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

36
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,490
YEAR 2018

37
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,978
ONE YEAR AGO

38
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,408
High Priest.

39
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,245
It's about time the red tide rushed in.

40
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,832
The divine realm will welcome
a new emperor after 3,000 years.

41
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,168
Where is Lord Habaek?

42
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,827
I am beyond honored
to be given this opportunity.

43
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,746
Thank you for your boundless generosity,
Lord Habaek.

44
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,793
Painting your noble face

45
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,297
is making me understand
why the universe has chosen you

46
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,340
to be our next king.

47
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,220
Now, please open your eyes...

48
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,858
Please allow me to complete
the most important part of this...

49
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,909
My lord, the High Priest asked me
to pass along this message to you.

50
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,911
Tell him to stop sending me
these messages.

51
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,248
Does he have that much to say?
He does this every day.

52
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,208
He said that the waters have reddened...

53
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,172
and that you should get ready.

54
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,728
Is His Majesty aware of it too?

55
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,271
He is delighted.

56
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,067
He has been waiting for the red tide
for a long time.

57
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,069
He has been on the throne for eons.

58
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,653
He must be exhausted.

59
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,491
This shows the locations of
the three deities with the sacred stone.

60
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,952
This will lead you to them.

61
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,291
My lord.

62
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,055
Mura is there from the Land of Water.
The Land of Earth must've sent Judong.

63
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,557
-What about the Land of the Sky?
-It's Biryeom.

64
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,475
What...

65
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,895
-Biryeom?
-The enthronement must take place

66
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,397
after the seventh red tide,

67
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,401
so you just have to come back
with the sacred stone before that.

68
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,694
-I'll come back right away.
-Why?

69
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,031
The world of mankind
is actually a pretty fun place.

70
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,826
We have plenty of time
before the last tide,

71
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,578
-so you should have some fun.
-I'm not interested.

72
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,627
By the way, why do we still have to follow
such meaningless customs?

73
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,842
Nothing in this world is meaningless.

74
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,345
Anyway,

75
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,558
I'll get rid of such meaningless customs
as soon as I ascend to the throne.

76
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,143
Sure.

77
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,770
You can do as you please
once you are on the throne.

78
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,732
It sounds like you're doubting
whether I can really do it.

79
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,692
Of course not.

80
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,112
You were born to be a king, my lord.

81
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,949
The throne will become yours,
even if you don't do anything.

82
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,454
No one can refute that
unless they're crazy.

83
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,166
Becoming a king in the divine realm
has nothing to do with humans,

84
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,001
so why is the sacred stone kept there?

85
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,461
What a hassle.

86
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,670
Well...

87
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,590
you have a question,

88
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,469
so you should stay there for a while
and find the answer.

89
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,637
It wasn't a question.

90
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,685
Oh, right. You've heard
about the divine servants, right?

91
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,814
Humans who made a pledge to serve us
generation after generation.

92
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,901
If you run into problems,
find descendants of that family.

93
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,029
Showing this to them

94
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,573
will naturally awaken them.

95
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
Then they'll serve you as their god.

96
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,411
I don't need it. I won't look for them.

97
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,250
It's a girl.

98
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,002
Would you like to see her face?

99
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,253
She's not bad.

100
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,088
No need.

101
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,175
Namsuri will be escorting you.

102
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,970
Keep the sacred pendant on you
at all times, even if it's inconvenient.

103
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,223
Don't leave it with your clothes.

104
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,851
The Land of the Sky has gone crazy.

105
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,395
They put Biryeom in charge
of looking after the sky.

106
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,105
That punk is incapable
of doing any work.

107
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,274
Why do you hate Biryeom so much?

108
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,817
You two used to be close friends.

109
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,278
He has no class.

110
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,447
Also,

111
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,824
he's not reliable.

112
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,910
You should learn about
the human world before you go.

113
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,037
That's why I'm taking you with me.

114
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,248
I heard you've been
to the world of mankind.

115
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,876
Sure. I do know a lot about it.

116
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,046
The moment you pass the Divine Gate,
you'll feel a sting.

117
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,256
But it's not that bad.

118
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,634
Get me the best kinds of clothes
that humans wear.

119
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,302
And don't forget a gift for Mura.

120
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,140
Have you seen the servant yet?

121
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,100
I heard it's a woman.

122
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,768
Is she pretty?

123
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,728
Oh, yes. Sure.

124
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,732
I received a revelation from
the alien gods of the planet Intro Q 2544.

125
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,736
My supervisor is TF 1004.
He seemed to be in a huge rush.

126
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,656
I see. What else?

127
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,243
Here on Earth, there are partners who
carry out such divine messages like I do.

128
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,996
The organization is spread
throughout the world.

129
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,748
But the strange thing is,

130
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,753
why did they send
this divine message to me

131
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,423
instead of the US partner?
That's my question.

132
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,301
Right. I wonder why.

133
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,934
"Inform Obama.
World peace is under threat."

134
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,853
That's what it means.

135
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,355
Are you...

136
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,320
What should I do?
I don't know the address.

137
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,198
Do you know that
he's out of the White Roof House?

138
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,634
So, even you don't believe me.

139
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,552
Don't say that. You're my patient, so--

140
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,929
What? Did you just call me a patient?

141
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,139
Again?

142
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,183
-Hey!
-I didn't mean...

143
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,229
-As a patient--
-I'm not a patient!

144
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
Right, Mr. Ma Bong-yeol.

145
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,067
I'll try my best to get Obama's address--

146
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,152
-Gosh!
-Don't lie to my face!

147
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,154
You don't even believe me!

148
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,075
Doctor. Doctor, please.

149
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,994
No one believes me. World peace is--

150
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,079
Let go, please.

151
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,081
It's under threat.

152
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,375
-Sir. Mr. Ma.
-World peace

153
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,002
-is under threat.
-Please let go of her.

154
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,713
It's true that world peace
is under threat.

155
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,759
You...

156
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,761
Can you speak our language?

157
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,347
Of course. It's nice to meet you.

158
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,767
I'm glad to meet you.

159
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,894
Let's get out of here.

160
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,315
This way. Go on.

161
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,526
Let's go.

162
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,407
-How could you communicate with him?
-I observed him.

163
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,327
It sounds like total bullshit, but it's
systematic like the Korean alphabet.

164
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,079
He's very smart, you know.

165
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,956
You're much better than me.

166
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,961
His family wanted to keep him
in the hospital, right?

167
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,046
I can't handle him.
Schedule an appointment.

168
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,883
-Come on. Don't give up so easily.
-You think I'm giving up easily?

169
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,261
Hey, I've been treating him for a year.

170
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,929
Admitting failure is never easy.

171
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,973
Should I keep him
for the sake of my pride?

172
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,893
-I'm sick of it.
-I get it.

173
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,896
Half of these are payment reminders.

174
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,316
DA DA FINANCIAL

175
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,110
The bank called to say they can't give you

176
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,070
-another extension.
-What?

177
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,989
Why not?

178
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,325
The clinic is not doing well,
and you don't pay the interest on time.

179
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,536
Then what? Do they want this clinic
to be shut down?

180
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,912
I guess so.

181
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,207
Get out.

182
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,501
-Give me your gown. I'll wash it for you.
-Forget it.

183
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,338
Do you want to grab a drink with me?

184
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,174
Why would I grab a drink with you?

185
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,637
I forgot to give you this.
It's for your land in Gangwon Province.

186
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,103
PROPERTY TAX

187
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,274
It still hasn't sold?

188
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,444
Who'd buy such a useless piece of land
filled with stones?

189
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,696
I really didn't need to inherit this.

190
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,740
We're really behind on our rent as well.

191
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,909
And you've already spent
half of the rent deposit.

192
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,203
By the way, why do you still work for me?

193
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,287
Quit now.

194
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,498
I want to repay the kindness I received.

195
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,625
-Your father--
-Shut it.

196
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,212
I don't want to hear it.

197
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,802
By the way,

198
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,513
do you still dream of leaving this country
for good?

199
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,724
Yes. As soon as I pay off all my debt,

200
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,684
I'll pack up and move to Vanuatu.

201
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,562
Just find a guy
who will clear your debt for you

202
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,189
and stay here.

203
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,775
No way. I don't like Korea.

204
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,320
Or maybe men don't like you.

205
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,534
Hey, I even got a diamond ring
from a wealthy man.

206
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,753
Found it.

207
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,467
I actually got this ring from a man.
Why wouldn't he believe me?

208
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,930
I found you because you were obviously
meant to be mine.

209
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,977
I can't believe his name is Ahn Bin.

210
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,603
It sounds so childish.

211
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,232
Take care of all the bills
and my interest payments.

212
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,159
Vanuatu, my love.

213
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,265
<i>Yes.</i>

214
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,684
<i>That's how life is supposed to be.</i>

215
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:05,195
I can't see a single star
in this polluted country.

216
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,373
I want money!
Please help me roll in money.

217
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,853
Hey, woman.

218
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,022
Woman.

219
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,802
I shall give you the honor
of lending me this.

220
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
Hey, woman.

221
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,498
Wake up.

222
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,752
You shouldn't sleep here.

223
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,216
This woman is such a nuisance.

224
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:00,936
What?

225
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,276
What's going on?

226
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,275
Hey, you thief!

227
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,865
How dare you call me a thief,
you rude woman!

228
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,580
I shall punish you later.

229
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,004
<i>What has happened?</i>

230
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,549
<i>Namsuri. What happened to him?</i>

231
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,595
My lord! You made it down here
safe and sound.

232
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,348
-What happened?
-I don't know.

233
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,599
I landed over there.

234
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,811
What happened to you?

235
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,355
That's what I wanted to ask you.
Why are you wearing my clothes?

236
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,481
Pardon?

237
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,527
How did this happen?

238
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,781
Let's switch.

239
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,700
This is strange.

240
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,371
The Divine Gate looks different
from what I saw 55 years ago.

241
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,914
Look closely.

242
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,084
Here, a lot can change,
even in just ten years.

243
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,754
The land that is used as the Divine Gate
never changes.

244
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,092
Then something must have gone wrong
on our way here.

245
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,312
-Where's the map?
-Pardon? Don't you have it?

246
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,523
Gosh!

247
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,695
Use your abilities to find it.

248
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,502
Did you find it, my lord?

249
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,963
What's wrong?

250
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,424
It's strange.

251
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,925
I feel as if...

252
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,261
something...

253
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,597
has left my body.

254
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,514
"Something"?

255
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,333
How could this happen?

256
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,126
You lost your abilities?

257
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,086
Let's go back
to the Land of Water for now.

258
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,214
-Take me to the Divine Gate.
-We can't go back now.

259
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,258
All gods must fulfill their duties
in order to return.

260
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,177
I told you to study.

261
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,055
First, let's find the descendant
of the servant.

262
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,056
We need her help now.

263
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,442
You don't have it?

264
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,695
What are we going to do now?

265
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,996
-Let me get a change of clothes first.
-I'm okay.

266
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,414
I'm not okay.

267
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,169
Please stay put.

268
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,464
Don't be so confident
and arrogant all the time.

269
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,466
And don't order anyone around, okay?

270
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,593
All right.

271
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,012
Gosh, this is crazy.

272
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,061
No.

273
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,563
That can't be.

274
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,319
<i>It's probably just a temporary phenomenon.</i>

275
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,489
<i>I couldn't use my power</i>
<i>during my first visit</i>

276
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,825
<i>to the Land of the Sky.</i>

277
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,686
So where are you now?

278
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,607
How many times do I have to tell you?
He stole my diamond ring.

279
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,361
I'm not drunk, okay?

280
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,530
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

281
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,115
Why did I come to the park?

282
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,663
I told you that I'm here
to find my diamond ring.

283
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,874
What? I'm delusional?

284
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,292
Hey.

285
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,544
Where are you?

286
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,837
<i>I am...</i>

287
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,464
<i>Habaek.</i>

288
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,426
Just answer my question.

289
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,635
<i>I am...</i>

290
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,387
<i>Habaek.</i>

291
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,264
Where are you, you idiot?

292
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,932
<i>I am Habaek.</i>

293
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,435
-Where?
-<i>I am Habaek!</i>

294
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,950
Jeez, that totally scared me.

295
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>See? I am Habaek.</i>

296
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,137
It's working fine.

297
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,223
There's nothing wrong with it.

298
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,682
Turn it off for now.

299
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,810
Let's test it a few more times.

300
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,745
<i>It's that woman.</i>

301
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,544
<i>What is he doing? Is he walking toward me?</i>

302
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,129
<i>Do I know that guy?</i>

303
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,564
<i>No, I don't know him.</i>

304
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,403
Hey, woman.

305
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,574
You're mistaken. I'm only borrowing it.

306
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,700
Sorry?

307
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,329
-Me?
-If you tell me your name

308
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,540
and where you live,
I'll have Namsuri pay you back.

309
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,877
What do you need?

310
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,131
<i>Seriously, even such a handsome guy</i>
<i>can be mentally ill.</i>

311
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,886
You should go home.
Your family must be worried.

312
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,013
-Don't hesitate to tell me.
-It's fine.

313
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,098
How insolent.

314
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,642
I asked you a question.
I didn't say you could go.

315
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,811
<i>For goodness' sake.</i>

316
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,279
I...

317
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,825
<i>Could he be delusional?</i>

318
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,202
What is it that you need?

319
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,335
Money?

320
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,379
"Money"?

321
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,591
"Money"?

322
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,594
What is that?

323
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,848
Never mind. You should hurry home.

324
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,891
Bye now.

325
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,938
-Let go!
-Your name and where you live.

326
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,316
Let go of my hand,
or I'll call the police.

327
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,567
-I said, let go!
-Doctor!

328
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,778
What are you doing? Let go!

329
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,865
Let go of her. Don't do this.

330
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,117
Such insolence. How dare you!

331
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,161
What happened to your forehead?

332
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,164
-Did he hit you?
-No, it's fine. Let's go.

333
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,333
I'm the God of Water,

334
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,002
the next king of the Land of Water
and the next emperor of the gods,

335
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,130
Habaek.

336
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,096
I knew it.

337
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,265
He's absorbed by grandiose delusions.

338
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,733
Here.

339
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,237
Come visit us. It's not far from here.

340
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,197
Our doctor is very good.

341
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,575
I hope to see you soon.

342
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,088
You know you're cut out
to be a psychiatrist, right?

343
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,466
People who need you
come to you day and night.

344
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,551
Be quiet.

345
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,929
I'm sure you'll only find people like him,
even in Vanuatu.

346
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,431
Wouldn't it be better to stay here?

347
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,017
I think Korea is still better.

348
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,393
Where's the nearest police station?

349
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,436
Why do you ask?

350
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,021
-Are you going to report it?
-Yes.

351
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,897
Calm down. He's not all there.

352
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,941
I'm going to file a report
about my diamond ring.

353
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,735
Are you still drunk?

354
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,362
They'll look into it
and get in touch with us.

355
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,448
THE POLICE PROMISE YOU
SAFETY AND HAPPINESS

356
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,574
Are you mad at me?

357
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,826
I don't think you believe me.

358
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,789
Let's say I believe you about
the diamond ring buried under a tree.

359
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,501
But you also went on about the star
frantically moving from left to right.

360
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,630
And the thief who fell from the sky
didn't take your wallet.

361
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,548
Why? So that you'd have money
to get around?

362
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,133
It really happened!

363
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,510
Shall I get you
a glass of cold water or what?

364
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,138
Right, she doesn't like cold water.
How about some warm water?

365
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,061
What took you so long?

366
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,897
I tried to get some information
about this world from humans

367
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,732
and find a place for you to stay tonight.

368
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,401
Let's go, my lord.
I've found a good place.

369
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,195
-It's close to water too.
-There's no need.

370
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,238
-I got my abilities back.
-Seriously?

371
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,448
The water you see behind us

372
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,493
splashed up as per my command.

373
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,244
I knew it.

374
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,205
Then please go ahead
and turn it into gold.

375
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,436
You'll be comfortable here
since it's very close to water.

376
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,437
This is it.

377
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,440
I took a while
because I had to inflate this.

378
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,323
A man gave it to me earlier,
saying I should visit.

379
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,908
You spoke with a human?

380
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,411
I told you not to say a word.

381
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,122
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH
NURSE YU SANG-YU

382
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,416
"Blessed Mental Health,

383
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,209
Nurse Yu Sang-yu"?

384
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,669
What?

385
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,130
Oh, I was just reading
what's written here.

386
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,132
You can't read the human alphabet, right?

387
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,638
Sleep well, my lord.

388
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,682
I'll stand guard here all night.

389
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,062
I'll try to find the map
as soon as the sun comes up.

390
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,074
<i>In the human world,</i>
<i>money can solve most problems.</i>

391
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,326
What is it that you need?

392
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,995
Money?

393
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,372
You're not pronouncing
that word correctly.

394
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,875
It's "money," you dummy.

395
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,461
Happy Bank also called for you.

396
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,214
-Did you take another loan out?
-It wasn't me.

397
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,430
Right.

398
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,228
Selling the diamond ring
won't solve my problems.

399
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,023
"Money"?

400
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,235
What is that?

401
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,825
Right, that probably allows him
to be carefree.

402
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,078
That's how life should be.

403
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,272
Let's talk while looking
around the resort.

404
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,190
Is the food and beverage team going first?

405
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,860
We have a banquet with 200 Chinese guests
scheduled for today.

406
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,321
The owner of a Chinese harbor
construction company will be there.

407
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,697
You should attend it so that--

408
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,991
I won't need to attend it
as he's not a national VIP.

409
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,826
-Anything from the planning team?
-Yes, sir.

410
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,371
This is the British company's
revised construction proposal.

411
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,374
The location is the same.
It's the site you checked the other day.

412
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,502
It's not bad. As long as
everything is okay with the site...

413
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,837
I'll go through it.

414
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,672
Any bank-related updates for me?

415
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,132
Yes, sir. A bank approached us

416
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,843
with an offer to lower the interest rate
for a number of loans.

417
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,220
They want to discuss it with you
over a meal.

418
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,265
Do I have to be there?

419
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,310
I think it'll be good
to meet with them in person.

420
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,606
<i>After that, they also succeeded</i>
<i>in detecting a second gravity wave.</i>

421
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,399
<i>It's possible</i>

422
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,028
<i>that third and fourth waves</i>
<i>are arriving as we speak,</i>

423
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,741
<i>and there might have been</i>
<i>a time and space warp in Seoul.</i>

424
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,786
<i>We'll learn more about gravity waves</i>
<i>on</i> Amazing Science <i>today.</i>

425
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,455
Hello.

426
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,999
-Any word from the police station?
-No, they haven't called.

427
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,878
Apparently, there might have been
a time and space warp in Seoul yesterday.

428
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,340
Perhaps your diamond ring disappeared
when that happened?

429
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,905
I bought it at the Dongdaemun Market
early this morning.

430
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,199
-Wear it for now.
-You should've gotten more sleep.

431
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,743
The doctors' gown is so important
for doctors.

432
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,162
-Doesn't your stomach hurt?
-I'm not hungover.

433
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,581
-Did you have breakfast?
-You're nagging again.

434
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,291
You have no food at home, right?

435
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,419
I should stop by
and make some side dishes.

436
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,920
-Do you have a death wish?
-The driver

437
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,464
who bumped your car last month,
Park Sang-cheol.

438
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,424
He called again.

439
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,759
I took care of everything
with the insurance company.

440
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,303
I don't even know. He said he'd come here,
then he changed his mind.

441
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,930
I don't know what he wants.

442
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,099
By the way, when will you go to the bank?

443
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,268
Putting it off won't solve the problem.

444
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,728
I know that too.

445
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,025
-Any appointments in the morning?
-No, obviously.

446
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,861
Your afternoon schedule is empty too,
so you can go whenever you want.

447
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,787
The interest too.
You always make the payments late.

448
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,875
On top of that, you've been managing
your credit very poorly.

449
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,336
You received an extremely low rating
in last year's evaluation.

450
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,799
Please review it again.

451
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,261
I've paid all of my taxes.
I'm just struggling temporarily.

452
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,889
Psychiatric clinics do very well
these days.

453
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,098
Then...

454
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,434
you can pay part of the amount
that you owe

455
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:25,063
and switch to an interest rate
that's around seven percent,

456
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,900
but I'm not sure
if the evaluation team will accept this.

457
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,234
Seven percent?

458
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,529
How can the interest rate jump
from four to seven percent?

459
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,243
Please look into it for me, then.

460
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,537
WARM WATER

461
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,048
Gosh, where did he go?

462
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,217
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH
NURSE YU SANG-YU

463
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,222
2:10 P.M., JUNE 24, 2017

464
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,316
Why is this taking so long?

465
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,279
Excuse me.

466
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,781
Just a moment, please.

467
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,835
Do I have to wait much longer?

468
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,546
I have to go back to my clinic
to attend to patients.

469
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,131
Just a moment, please.

470
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,263
Gosh! My goodness!

471
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,145
Sir, did you have a good lunch?

472
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,565
Would you like a cup of pour over coffee
made with organic beans?

473
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,276
If you choose to go
with our loan services,

474
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,529
-we can offer you one-percent interest.
-What? One percent?

475
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,159
Excuse me.

476
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,538
-I told you to wait.
-I can't wait all day.

477
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,749
You've kept me waiting since this morning.

478
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,544
I'm not asking for a new loan.
I just want an extension.

479
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,254
Is it that hard to check it for me?

480
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,175
And why are you walking around
with my personal information?

481
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,220
Well...

482
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,598
Please wait outside.

483
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,600
I told you I won't wait any longer.

484
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,103
And why do I have to pay seven percent
when he's getting one percent?

485
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,938
How can you treat your customers
so unfairly?

486
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,191
-Well, that's--
-I know. I know the reason.

487
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,568
But this is out of line.

488
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,904
The difference
between one and seven percent is huge!

489
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,822
Please help her first.

490
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,992
You can discuss this with my finance team.

491
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,622
Sir, wait. You can't just leave like this.

492
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,291
Ma'am, I'd like you to apologize
to Mr. Shin.

493
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,128
-What did you say?
-You just cut in line.

494
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,963
He's leaving because he's upset.

495
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,050
That is not true.

496
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,845
It's the bank's fault for revealing
the interest rate to other customers.

497
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,641
-You're the one who should apologize.
-Sorry?

498
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,061
I'll ask the bank
if you could get the loan.

499
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,395
Why would you do that for me?

500
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,359
You don't seem to know
how to accept kindness.

501
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,320
Then instead of bothering the bank staff
regarding your interest rate,

502
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,572
you should work harder
to earn money on your own.

503
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,334
-Please visit our clinic.
-Okay.

504
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,920
-Right.
-Excuse me, sir. Please visit...

505
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,425
No, wait. Stop!

506
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,055
Why would you scrape off bird poop
with our business card?

507
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,475
Seriously, why would you do that?

508
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,061
-My goodness.
-What's going on?

509
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,271
It's nothing, sir.

510
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:54,939
What happened?

511
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,149
Why did you scrape off bird poop
with our business card?

512
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,068
-Why?
-Please calm down.

513
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,074
Please give me a call.
I'll take care of this.

514
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,492
A business card
is the face of that business.

515
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,203
You practically wiped bird poop
with our clinic's reputation!

516
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,372
-Enough. Let's go.
-Think about it.

517
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
Why do you think
cars have windshield wipers?

518
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,334
You're supposed to wipe things off
with this.

519
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,378
What's the point of having a big car?

520
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,051
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

521
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,720
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH
NURSE YU SANG-YU

522
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,430
A psychiatric clinic?

523
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,142
I'll call you when I get an estimate
of the repair cost.

524
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,659
Hello.

525
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,369
My lord.

526
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,541
Where's the map? Did you find it?

527
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,793
I couldn't find it anywhere.

528
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,087
I think we lost it on our way down here.

529
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,255
On our way here?

530
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,384
-Does that mean we can't find it?
-That's right.

531
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,596
By the way, what are you doing out here?
I told you to stay home.

532
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,099
"Home"?

533
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,607
You slept so soundly last night.
I thought you were going to stand guard.

534
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,235
I must've fallen asleep
because I was tired and hungry.

535
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,696
-You were hungry?
-Yes.

536
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,116
I get hungry around mealtimes
just like humans do.

537
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,369
You probably don't even know
what hunger feels like.

538
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,997
Do I have to listen to you
whining like this?

539
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:35,956
No.

540
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,211
Are you that hungry?

541
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,214
Yes, I'm quite hungry.

542
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,134
I'm sorry.

543
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,513
This is all because I've lost my power.

544
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,850
I can't even take care of
a loyal servant like you.

545
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,311
How can I become a good king
when I'm this incompetent?

546
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,231
What? No! That is not true, my lord!

547
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,817
Don't tell me you were
actually expecting me to say that.

548
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,152
Of course not.

549
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,279
By the way, what is that thing?

550
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,493
Well, that's...

551
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,912
It's not food.

552
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,046
-Let's go to that place.
-Sorry? Where?

553
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,589
The Divine Gate.

554
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,842
The divine servants
have been guarding that place,

555
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,969
so I'm sure we can find out
where the descendant is.

556
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,430
What? Are you planning to meet
the descendant?

557
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,599
I should give that servant
a chance to faithfully serve me...

558
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,646
as the generous and dutiful god that I am.

559
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,815
What should we do?

560
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,818
What if that wiper costs a fortune?

561
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,946
Then I might have to move out of my place.

562
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,782
Why did you have to get
all riled up like that?

563
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,327
Because he wiped bird poop
with our business card.

564
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,037
You love your job too much.

565
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,043
Why did it have to be that guy's car?

566
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,467
Are you calling Mr. Min?

567
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,219
-Ask him if we can pay less.
-Mr. Min, my foot!

568
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,147
Jeez, this realtor never answers my calls.

569
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,775
Forget it.

570
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,322
-I have to go to Gangwon Province.
-Right now?

571
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,241
You should probably
change your tires first.

572
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,118
You also need to change the brake fluid,

573
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,411
the navigation device, and...

574
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,875
The windshield wiper.

575
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,383
Why isn't this working again?

576
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,346
Must you make it so obvious
that you're a second-hand car?

577
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,139
My gosh.

578
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,599
There we go.

579
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,459
Did you say you need to go
to Jeongbong Village?

580
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,711
You need to go straight.

581
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,713
Just keep going that way.

582
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,633
Then turn left when you feel like
you've arrived at the right place.

583
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:37,304
Then keep going and turn right
when you feel like you've walked enough,

584
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,724
and you'll eventually arrive
at the village. Okay?

585
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,320
What did he say to us just now?

586
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,198
He just meant
that it's not too far from here.

587
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,285
Don't worry. I've been here several times.

588
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,294
<i>No one has called about that land</i>
<i>for the past five years.</i>

589
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,671
That's why I asked you to put up a sign

590
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,716
and tell people that the land is for sale.

591
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,468
Jeez, okay. I heard you.

592
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,765
I came here to ask if I could
lower the price to sell it urgently.

593
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,392
Even if you lowered the price,

594
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,978
nobody would want to buy
such a useless piece of land.

595
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,187
Sir.

596
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,482
I know it's useless, but you shouldn't
say that to the landowner.

597
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,068
So, how much?

598
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,321
-Is it going to be half the price?
-What?

599
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,289
This is where we were supposed to land.

600
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,333
I don't think
the gate is visible to humans.

601
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,419
Why did they build the gate
on such an unimpressive piece of land?

602
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,130
By the way, that servant
won't know a thing. What do we do?

603
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,049
We need to show her the pendant

604
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,134
in order for her to realize
that she's your servant.

605
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,052
Don't worry.

606
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,553
I have a plan.

607
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,512
What's your plan?

608
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,432
She'll fall for my charm,

609
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,476
so she'll naturally want to serve me.

610
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,148
If that doesn't work,
I'll have to use my last resort.

611
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,400
And what might that be?

612
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,197
What? No, you can't do that.

613
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,158
-Why not?
-You should never do that.

614
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,369
We can pick up the pendant
on our way back.

615
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,913
Then she'll forget everything,

616
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,332
but that won't be possible
if you use that last resort.

617
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,918
That would be too torturous for a human.

618
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:37,216
You've been talking nonsense nonstop
since yesterday.

619
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,928
What is this stupid nonsense
you're spewing now?

620
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:46,558
Most importantly, you've lost your power.
How will that even work?

621
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,853
What does that have to do with my power?
Am I not a god without my power?

622
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,483
Why don't you take my place, then?

623
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,528
My gosh, how could you say such a thing?
No way, my lord.

624
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,488
Excuse me.

625
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,742
May I ask what brings you here?

626
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,956
I own this land.

627
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,059
<i>It was you.</i>

628
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,105
Let go of her. Don't do this.

629
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,565
I'm the God of Water,

630
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,401
the next king of the Land of Water,
and the next emperor of the gods,

631
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,195
Habaek.

632
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,948
<i>What is he doing here?</i>

633
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,576
-Are you the owner of this land?
-Yes, I am.

634
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,831
-Are you here to buy this land?
-Why would I buy my own land?

635
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,749
What?

636
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,019
I've looked all over for you,
my faithful servant.

637
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,063
I'm very glad to finally meet you.

638
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,274
You should be grateful...

639
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,862
that I'm glad to meet you.

640
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,164
What are you doing?

641
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,165
How dare you.

642
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,502
<i>You know you're cut out</i>
<i>to be a psychiatrist, right?</i>

643
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,505
<i>People who need you</i>
<i>come to you day and night.</i>

644
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,714
I need to go see Yeom-mi.

645
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,633
I think it's time.

646
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,179
My lord.

647
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,265
Please give me a heads-up
before you do anything.

648
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,354
Hey, Yeom-mi. Are you free tonight?

649
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,857
No, you must make time for me.
We need to meet.

650
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,985
I'm in Gangwon Province right now.
Oh, gosh!

651
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,906
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

652
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,201
Hey, I'll call you later.

653
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,207
Are you okay? Let me see.

654
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,167
No, I'm fine.

655
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,628
-He is not fine.
-Right, I don't think I'm fine.

656
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,089
I'm not fine.

657
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,896
<i>You've entered the route</i>
<i>to your destination.</i>

658
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,149
I'll drop you off at a hospital nearby.

659
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,151
Let's call the insurance company there.

660
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,697
-No. We're coming with you.
-<i>Turn left.</i>

661
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,656
Excuse me.

662
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,701
He said he's not fine.
He can't go all the way to Seoul.

663
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,494
And can't you talk politely?

664
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,621
I don't know what you mean.
Just try to have an awakening soon.

665
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,540
Then you'll understand the situation.

666
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,917
Understanding the situation
will make things so much easier.

667
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,128
<i>What is he saying?</i>

668
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,965
Look. Is there a specific clinic
that you normally go to?

669
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,301
If not, you can come to my...

670
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,844
What am I saying?

671
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:11,889
Excuse me.

672
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,850
I'm a doctor. Your friend here is--

673
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,394
He's not my friend. He's my servant.

674
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,729
Your servant...

675
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,066
I mean, that guy sitting next to you

676
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,736
seems fine to me.

677
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,988
I'm taking you with me
because I don't want to get sued,

678
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,657
-so let's just settle.
-I don't understand what you're saying.

679
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,997
I don't think I came this way.

680
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,380
<i>Turn right.</i>

681
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,302
There's no road that turns right.

682
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,393
<i>Go straight ahead</i>
<i>until further instruction.</i>

683
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,146
I don't think I'm going
in the right direction.

684
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,902
<i>Turn right.</i>

685
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,739
<i>Turn left.</i>

686
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,283
<i>Go straight ahead</i>
<i>until further instruction.</i>

687
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,411
<i>Make a U-turn.</i>

688
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,303
<i>Turn left.</i>

689
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,014
-This is nuts.
-<i>Beware of the bend on your left.</i>

690
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,769
<i>Go straight.</i>

691
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,188
-There's no road here!
-<i>Then make a P-turn.</i>

692
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,482
-Where are you telling me to go?
-<i>This is an unpaved road.</i>

693
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,068
<i>Go straight ahead. Please drive safely.</i>

694
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,743
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

695
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,706
What can I do for you?

696
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,334
Nothing.

697
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,378
Do you want me to drive?

698
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,588
Do you have a driver's license?

699
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,007
What's that?

700
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,347
Never mind.

701
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,435
Doctors should never let
their patients drive.

702
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,368
<i>Turn right.</i>

703
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,643
SERVICE UNAVAILABLE

704
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,145
No!

705
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,316
What's going on?

706
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,735
The car stopped because it ran out of gas.

707
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,278
Then get her some gas.

708
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,947
How?

709
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,580
Can I use your phone?

710
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,333
Your cell phone.

711
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,335
Don't you have one?

712
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,844
Fine. Let's walk, then.

713
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,596
I'm sure we'll run into someone.

714
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,057
Let's borrow a cell phone
and call my insurance company,

715
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,683
or we can try to go buy gas ourselves.

716
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,435
I don't understand what you're saying,

717
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,521
but you should get some rest.

718
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,773
-What?
-You said you're tired.

719
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,734
Stay here and get some rest.
Namsuri will go by himself.

720
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,029
But he's hurt.

721
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,031
Yes, I'm in pain.

722
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,574
-He's not hurt.
-I think I'm okay now.

723
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,369
-I feel fine.
-Go on.

724
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,499
No, it's okay. I'll go.
It won't take long.

725
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,127
My gosh, what are you doing?

726
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,882
I don't even know where I am now.

727
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,595
Wait.

728
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,222
Yes?

729
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,391
My license plate number

730
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,059
and the insurance company's number
are written here.

731
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,604
And here's some money for gas.
Oh, just a second.

732
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,903
I almost forgot to give you this.

733
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,365
All right.

734
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,832
Why is everything...

735
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,710
so difficult today?

736
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,280
Excuse me.

737
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,202
You can wait inside the car.

738
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,755
I'm okay, so you go ahead
and rest up in the car.

739
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,217
My name is Habaek, not "Excuse me."

740
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,761
I'm the God of Water,
the next king of the Land of Water,

741
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,430
and the next emperor of the gods.

742
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,431
And...

743
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,182
I am your master.

744
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:12,851
Ha...

745
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,103
baek.

746
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,484
<i>Gosh, I keep forgetting</i>
<i>that he's mentally ill.</i>

747
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:23,903
Excuse...

748
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:25,822
I mean, Mr. Habaek.

749
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,409
Why do you think
that you're the God of Water?

750
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,369
What kind of question is that?

751
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,497
Then let me ask you this.
Why do you think you're human?

752
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,088
Fine.

753
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,090
Then,

754
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,926
what exactly is the God of Water?

755
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,095
What are you trying to do right now?

756
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,768
Are you seeking to gain knowledge?

757
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,272
It seems like you wish to talk
about the essence of the world.

758
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:01,941
Listen to me carefully.

759
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,028
The God of Water, the God of the Sky,
and the God of Earth.

760
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,238
We are equal to nature itself.

761
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:08,948
Thus,

762
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,452
I am nature.

763
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,041
-Are you talking about the TV show?
-I said, I am nature.

764
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,878
-The show,Â <i>I Am a Natural Person?</i>
-No, I am nature.<i> </i>More importantly,

765
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,672
I am the most essential part of nature.

766
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,719
What?

767
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,234
I mean, he looks completely normal.

768
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,863
Stop peeping at me.

769
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,032
I can see it even with my eyes closed.

770
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,744
I'm so used to others
looking at me like that.

771
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,037
<i>Sure,</i>

772
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,248
<i>I bet.</i>

773
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,169
You have...

774
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:04,879
a family, right?

775
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,507
I can say that I do,
but then I can also say that I don't.

776
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:11,136
The notion of family is different
in the divine realm.

777
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,512
Then who's that guy--

778
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,557
I told you that he's my servant. Like you.

779
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,308
He's my servant from the divine realm,

780
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,561
and you're my servant
here in the human world.

781
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,232
-Hey, servant.
-Yes?

782
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,361
-Hey.
-Call me Lord Habaek!

783
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,492
Is money really what you need...

784
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,202
the most?

785
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,163
Why do you ask?

786
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:41,040
Why do humans need money so much?

787
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,547
It's because money can make you happy.

788
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,757
You too?

789
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,302
Yes. Why?

790
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,387
I think..

791
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,556
I can help you with it.

792
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,769
But not right now.

793
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,730
I'm in a bit of a situation now.

794
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,859
<i>Why do I keep on letting him fool me?</i>

795
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:10,945
Hey, servant.

796
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:15,074
You said money is what you need the most,

797
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,870
but money will give you happiness.

798
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,581
Therefore, happiness must be
what you really need the most.

799
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,337
You don't even know anything about me.

800
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,798
I have no interest whatsoever
in a mere woman's happiness,

801
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,009
so I will repay you with money.

802
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,184
We should look for it together.

803
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,817
-Are we going the right way?
-I'm not sure.

804
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,736
I think we're lost.

805
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,864
You're calmer than I expected you to be.

806
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,450
I have to stay calm, of course.

807
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,245
I'm your guardian at the moment.

808
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,496
"Guardian"?

809
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,622
Yes.

810
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,252
You may find it hard to believe,
but I have a medical license.

811
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,091
I hope your underling or colleague,
whoever he is, went the right way.

812
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,182
We shouldn't keep going.

813
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,892
We should go back.

814
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,812
-I've been wanting to say that.
-Hey, I'll lead the way.

815
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,355
Hey, servant.

816
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,737
This is your last warning.

817
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,281
Listen carefully.

818
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,200
I'm not "Hey."
You have to call me Lord Habaek.

819
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,911
The God of Water,
the next king of the Land of Water,

820
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,080
and the next emperor of the divine world,

821
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,207
Habaek.

822
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,594
Now, it's your turn to listen up.

823
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,805
My name is Yun So-a, not "Servant."

824
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,932
Since I'm acting as your guardian now,

825
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,685
it'd be nice if you could call me Dr. Yun.

826
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,271
If you don't want to do that,
please at least call me Ms. Yun.

827
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:09,981
Are we clear?

828
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,275
How insolent.

829
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,542
-What is it?
-Run!

830
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,095
Wait, let's get in the car. Gosh!

831
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,026
The trunk!

832
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,476
Why is it all quiet now?

833
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,022
I think it's gone.

834
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,026
-Are you okay?
-I'm very uncomfortable right now.

835
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,194
Pardon?

836
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,075
Don't move. You're making it worse.

837
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,203
Okay.

838
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,337
I think it's gone. Let's open it and see.

839
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,016
What is that?

840
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,444
Gosh, it smiled! It actually smiled.

841
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,321
What a crazy boar!

842
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,277
Lord Habaek.

843
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,176
Can you walk?

844
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,928
Let's rest up for a few minutes.

845
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,223
What happened?

846
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,475
I got lost in the woods and met a hunter.

847
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,435
I'm so glad he came with me.

848
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,646
Where is he?

849
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,606
He followed the boar.

850
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,525
Did you get hurt?

851
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,669
Well, I thought you couldn't drive.

852
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:42,962
I couldn't.

853
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,172
Then what's happening now?

854
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,549
I'm a good driver now.

855
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,636
I've never done this before, but it's fun.

856
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,263
What?

857
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,144
Does that mean
you don't have a driver's license?

858
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,397
-What is a driver's license?
-Hey!

859
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,107
Pull over right now. I'll drive.

860
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,358
Just get some rest!

861
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:08,362
This is a huge honor for you,
so don't reject my kind gesture.

862
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,992
I am just doing what I should do
as the generous and dutiful god that I am.

863
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,035
Hey!

864
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,497
Don't worry.

865
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,460
Lord Habaek possesses
some incredible abilities

866
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,753
that humans can't even imagine.

867
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,838
Abilities, my foot. Pull over right now!

868
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,303
I said, pull over!

869
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,409
Is this where you live?

870
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:05,252
-Did you lie to us?
-What are you talking about? I lied?

871
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,133
Anyway,

872
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,886
thank you for everything today.

873
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,639
It happened a long time ago.

874
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:23,771
An unknown ancestor of yours
made a promise with the gods.

875
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,316
He made a pledge that his family
would serve the gods for generations.

876
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,027
You didn't make that promise,
but that's beside the point.

877
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,405
You're a descendant of the man
who made that promise.

878
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,281
Therefore,
you must serve me if I want you to.

879
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,076
Take me to your house.

880
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:42,581
No. You can go to the hospital instead.

881
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,333
If you refuse, you will suffer.

882
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,628
It doesn't matter because
I'm already having a hard enough time.

883
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,255
You're right.

884
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,091
Happiness may be what I truly want

885
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,592
because I'm really exhausted.

886
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,012
So, do me a favor...

887
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,431
and leave me alone.

888
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,017
Please.

889
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,398
I can't believe
she still hasn't realized her fate

890
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,567
after everything I've taught her.

891
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,402
How foolish.

892
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,904
I guess I have no choice.

893
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,364
Namsuri.

894
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:16,657
Because of what you said,

895
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,993
I've been trying to refrain
from using my last resort.

896
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,704
But now, I have no choice.

897
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:22,830
But, my lord,

898
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,041
-your power could--
-Hey, servant!

899
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:43,768
I shall grace you with my blessing,

900
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,437
so wake up already.

901
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,605
<i>Don't you feel like something</i>
<i>in your heart...</i>

902
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,982
<i>Why did I close my eyes?</i>

903
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,360
<i>Doesn't it feel like something</i>
<i>in your heart's smacking your head?</i>

904
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,279
-Absolutely not!
-<i>You slow-witted woman! I'm right here!</i>

905
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,364
Gosh, what a psycho!

906
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,075
<i>-It must be fate.</i>
<i>-You now belong to the deity.</i>

907
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,577
<i>-You're wrong.</i>
<i>-I'm so sick of this nonsense about gods.</i>

908
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,788
<i>Accept your fate,</i>
<i>or you must go through everything.</i>

909
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,873
<i>What do you mean by "everything"?</i>

910
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,208
No!

911
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,461
<i>-She's falling!</i>
<i>-Get her!</i>

912
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,630
<i>Please save me.</i>

913
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:58,676
Will we leave right away?

914
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,594
Yes, I left while he was painting me.

915
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,012
Exactly.

916
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,764
You could've told him
to come back later on.

917
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,057
Why are you punishing him?

918
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,269
EPILOGUE

919
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,228
When did I punish him?

920
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,650
When is Lord Habaek coming back?

921
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,820
I should've drawn his eyes
when I had the chance to.
