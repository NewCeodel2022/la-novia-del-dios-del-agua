1
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,535
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEM

2
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,026
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

3
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,823
-Is this where you're staying?
-Yes.

4
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,369
Why are you alone?

5
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,247
Namsuri?

6
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,876
-I lost him.
-How?

7
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,336
It's none of your business.

8
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,175
You can't keep living here.

9
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,886
Have you made up your mind
to give me your house and yourself?

10
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,721
No, that's not what I meant.

11
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,181
No?

12
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,267
Then what did you mean?

13
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,188
I think you should seek help
from the welfare system.

14
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,982
I don't understand what that means.

15
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,527
If you haven't decided to dedicate
your house and yourself to me,

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,778
you should just leave.

17
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,534
Did I thank you?

18
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,785
Yes, you did.

19
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,496
Then goodbye.

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,414
All right.

21
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,585
I didn't really save your life
or anything like that,

22
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,671
-right?
-Sorry?

23
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,804
Get going.

24
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>You ungrateful wench.</i>

25
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>You're such an ingrate.</i>

26
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,922
<i>Have aÂ conscience, will you?</i>

27
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,760
<i>That's when it started.</i>

28
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,304
That's when she started

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,098
hearing weird sounds ringing in her ears.

30
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,516
Well, what I mean is,

31
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,102
something keeps talking to her.

32
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,228
<i>What's talking to her?</i>

33
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,398
Flowers and water.

34
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,902
Things like trees, rocks, and ants.

35
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,779
-And oranges too.
<i>-Oranges?</i>

36
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,451
<i>At first, it wasn't a big deal at all.</i>

37
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>Gosh!</i>

38
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,247
<i>It wouldn't have been strange even</i>
<i>if she had thought she misheard it.</i>

39
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>-I try not to say things like this.</i>
<i>-But you're too much.</i>

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,418
<i>I'm a plant too.</i>

41
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,045
<i>You heartless woman, you killed a cactus!</i>

42
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>The second time she heard it,</i>

43
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>she just thought it was happening</i>
<i>because she was tired.</i>

44
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,469
<i>There's nothing to eat in this house.</i>

45
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,304
<i>I'll go visit the next-door neighbor.</i>

46
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>The third time she heard it,</i>

47
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,560
<i>she thought she must be exhausted</i>
<i>and just needed some rest.</i>

48
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,773
<i>Why do you Korean folks</i>
<i>keep pronouncing my name wrong?</i>

49
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,567
<i>Repeat after me. Orange.</i>

50
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,277
<i>O, R...</i>

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>The fourth time she heard it,</i>

52
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,993
<i>she thought that it was because</i>
<i>she was completely drained of energy.</i>

53
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,956
<i>Go around again!</i>

54
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,167
<i>Round and round!</i>

55
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,420
<i>But...</i>

56
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,425
<i>Now, she doesn't think being tired</i>
<i>can explain what's been happening.</i>

57
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,179
-I'm talking about A.
-So she has reality testing

58
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,181
capabilities and maintains
proper ego boundaries?

59
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,851
It's not like she has
bipolar disorder either, right?

60
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,354
It's not an organic disorder
or a feigned illness either?

61
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,689
No.

62
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,108
The first things Patient A heard

63
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,442
might tell you something.

64
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,528
"You ungrateful wench.
You're such an ingrate."

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,780
-And told you to have a conscience.
-Yes.

66
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,365
Could it be her sense of guilt?

67
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,284
Her sense of guilt?

68
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,619
<i>She might be feeling guilty</i>
<i>about ignoring someone in need.</i>

69
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,707
Sorry, but we don't have a place to go.

70
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,041
Please help us.

71
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,335
<i>You said B, whom A met by chance,</i>

72
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,962
-<i>did her a big favor.</i>
-What?

73
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,964
You're one reckless woman.

74
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,424
No!

75
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,929
Isn't it absurd that her sense of guilt
is causing her to hear things?

76
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,347
<i>Wouldn't it depend on the person?</i>

77
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,142
Judging from what you told me,
Patient A seems to be

78
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,311
<i>a person who is kind at heart</i>

79
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,396
<i>but has been trying to hide it.</i>

80
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,106
<i>She might be a different person</i>
<i>on the inside.</i>

81
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,234
<i>She probably hates it that</i>
<i>she is so compassionate,</i>

82
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>which causes her to intentionally</i>
<i>behave in the opposite way.</i>

83
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,907
<i>But the gap between her psyche</i>
<i>and her actions must cause stress.</i>

84
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,036
<i>There must be a reason</i>
<i>why she hates her nature.</i>

85
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,413
<i>Bad experiences in the past, for example.</i>

86
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,458
<i>You said B, the homeless man,</i>
<i>was even abandoned by his friend, C</i>

87
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,834
<i>and has nowhere to go.</i>

88
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,752
What?

89
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,215
Are you saying you saw Mura in this?

90
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,179
-Yes.
-You should have told me.

91
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,264
You were starving, and you know nothing.

92
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,808
-If you keep acting on your own--
-Will you stop?

93
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,938
I can't believe something like this
happened to Mura.

94
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,774
I wonder what she's been through.

95
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,068
How should we save her?

96
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,531
Lady Mura.

97
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,117
Can you hear me?

98
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,455
Are you pulling my leg?

99
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,207
Sorry?

100
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,755
This is the cleverest thing humans
have ever invented except cars.

101
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,799
I want to know what I saw.

102
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,050
Give it back to me now.

103
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,056
Do you want to see
my skateboard tricks again?

104
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,557
No.

105
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,612
Why doesn't a grown-up have a cell phone?

106
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,200
Being a grown-up doesn't mean
having everything.

107
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,828
You're just a kid.
It's none of your business.

108
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,081
By the way, where did you get that?

109
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,791
Are you signing up for the first time?

110
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,001
For service providers, you can
choose among LK, JT, and SG.

111
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,421
If you choose JT, you don't have
to pay any start-up fees.

112
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,338
Choose a design too.

113
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
What is your budget range?

114
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,009
You can get a subsidy of 320,000 won.

115
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,429
Depending on your data usage
and the number of calls and texts,

116
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,514
your monthly bill will be
around 50,000 won.

117
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,433
You can also get
250 minutes of free calls,

118
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,436
unlimited free texts, and 2G of LTE data.

119
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,813
You can play games and use search engines.

120
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,731
How long would you like
your subscription to be?

121
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,192
If you choose two years,
you can pay your monthly bill

122
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,028
plus the phone price
in installments over 24 months.

123
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,240
You can get a discount if a family member
uses the same provider.

124
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,950
Under whose name would you like it to be?

125
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,704
Please give me your ID card.
I'd like you to fill out this form.

126
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,205
Here are some pens.

127
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,793
Phone service subscription form?

128
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,214
Like this.

129
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,643
<i>I think we need Ms. Descendant's help.</i>

130
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,273
Help?

131
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,817
Did I say "help"?

132
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,569
I think I said, "duty".

133
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,488
Mr. Nam!

134
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,573
Mr. Nam. We have customers.

135
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,657
Okay.

136
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,243
I have to work.

137
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,120
Don't go anywhere. Please stay here.

138
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:17,997
By the way,

139
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,000
where did you get those clothes?

140
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,086
I found them in a recycling bin.
Do you want some too?

141
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,923
Do you want to go back
to being a fish again?

142
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,055
Again? You just ate.

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,475
You become hungry more often than I do.

144
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,779
In my opinion,
this is the best invention by humans.

145
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,989
They swell up in your stomach.

146
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,658
Be patient.

147
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,451
I'll get some buns when I'm paid.

148
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,910
-What happened to you?
-It's your fault.

149
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,913
It's my fault.

150
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,167
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

151
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,336
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

152
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,088
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

153
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,673
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

154
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,549
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

155
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,552
Well...

156
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,683
I don't think I fulfilled my duties
as a psychiatrist.

157
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,351
So-- My gosh!

158
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,023
Are you okay?

159
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:31,982
Yes.

160
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,738
I've been thinking about you.

161
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,948
Sorry?

162
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,034
From when the sun rises in the east...

163
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,038
until the sun sets in the west,
all I think about...

164
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,623
is you.

165
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,460
Nothing could get you off my mind.

166
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,927
Why would you think about me?

167
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,054
It's not like you're a bear.

168
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,142
I just can't understand
how you can be so clumsy and stupid.

169
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,269
Because I couldn't understand,

170
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,895
I had to think about it all the time.

171
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,441
I didn't want to,
but I kept thinking about you.

172
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,278
It seems like your legs are stupid too.

173
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,904
I think I should go.

174
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,295
Let me get to the point.

175
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,215
My professor is a great person.

176
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,801
She's given so many people
happiness and peace.

177
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,595
It has nothing to do with me.

178
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,681
I'm not capable
of giving you those things.

179
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,682
I don't need them.

180
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,352
I'll talk to my professor.

181
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,480
-She can--
-I've learned many things here.

182
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,358
One of them is that you become abnormal
if you tell the truth.

183
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,779
If you say you're a divine servant,

184
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,198
-will people think you're normal?
-No.

185
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,783
No.

186
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,868
No, that's not what it's about.

187
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,827
See?

188
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,582
I'm the only one who trusts you.

189
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,003
Do you think it's easy
to win someone's trust?

190
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:20,341
How great is it to have someone
who trusts you?

191
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,011
That's...

192
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,972
who you are.

193
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:36,148
Come to me if you change your mind.

194
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,620
I've done enough.

195
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,082
My conscience is fine. It sure is.

196
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,376
It feels so refreshing.

197
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,379
If you don't accept me,
you'll go through everything.

198
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,006
Do I really have to repeat myself?

199
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,139
It feels so refreshing.

200
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,308
How refreshing it is.

201
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,227
It sure feels refreshing.

202
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,980
<i>The mites are making me itch.</i>

203
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,398
It feels so refreshing.

204
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,524
I feel great.

205
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,402
-Gosh, I feel amazing.
-<i>I feel sticky. Give me a bath.</i>

206
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,611
I feel so relieved.

207
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,197
<i>You dumped rotten milk on me</i>
<i>the other day, didn't you?</i>

208
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,408
I feel so refreshed!

209
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,287
I have sole control over my mind.

210
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,247
-<i>What are you going to do?</i>
-Be quiet!

211
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,249
What is it? What's wrong?

212
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,501
-What's happening?
-<i>Woman, you have no conscience.</i>

213
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,253
I have a clear conscience.

214
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,046
Doctor!

215
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,632
Shouldn't you have knocked? Get out.

216
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,094
Doctor, why are you getting
so aggressive these days?

217
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,221
-What are you talking about?
-You've become so impatient,

218
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,723
and you yell at me all the time.

219
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,893
You even talk to yourself.
You need to get proper sleep.

220
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,228
What do you do at night
instead of sleeping?

221
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,354
Do you watch porn or what?

222
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,148
You said you're into
<i>Game of Thrones</i> these days.

223
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,984
Are you sure it's not an erotic video
with the same title?

224
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,530
I need some rest.

225
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,325
What time is
the next patient's appointment?

226
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,370
"There's nothing, of course.

227
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,540
Both your morning and afternoon
are completely empty,

228
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,792
so you can rest whenever you want."

229
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,320
One more thing.
Mr. Park Sang-cheol called again.

230
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,739
Gosh, whatever.

231
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,244
What?

232
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,247
Go ahead and talk all you want.

233
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,667
Blabber away.

234
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:06,173
I have a completely clear conscience.

235
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,133
Fine dust? Yellow dust? What are they?

236
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,177
I have no idea
because I've never experienced them.

237
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,432
What's the problem?
Have you run out of things to say?

238
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,143
Or are you sleeping now?

239
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,527
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH
DOCTOR YUN SO-A

240
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,865
What am I doing now?

241
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,411
I must be going crazy.

242
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,957
<i>If you don't accept me,</i>
<i>you'll go through everything.</i>

243
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,004
This is complete nonsense.

244
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,550
SO-A

245
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,885
-What's up, So-a?
-Hey, there's a guy.

246
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,096
-<i>Is this an update on A's story?</i>
-No.

247
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>Is he handsome?</i>

248
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,016
Yes. I mean, no.

249
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,101
-<i>Whom does he look like?</i>
-Jude Law?

250
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,270
No, I was just kidding.

251
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>I guess he's the sexy type. Is he rich?</i>

252
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,024
I don't think so.

253
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,360
Hey, stop talking. Just listen.

254
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,653
Go ahead.

255
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,239
<i>Every time I see him,</i>
<i>he says weird things to me.</i>

256
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,157
Like what?

257
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,951
In those scary paranormal dramas,

258
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,079
you see people encountering
monks or mountain deities

259
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,457
-who randomly threaten them.
-You mean, like a curse?

260
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,209
Well, not exactly a curse.
But something like that.

261
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,003
When you don't do as they say,

262
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,630
the curse continues to haunt you.
You know those movies, right?

263
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,925
Can things like that actually happen
in real life?

264
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,261
Did I seriously just say that?
What am I saying right now?

265
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,929
I'm sorry. I have to go.

266
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,063
Take a picture.

267
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,815
I guess I'm extremely exhausted
these days.

268
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,234
QUACK

269
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,656
My gosh.
Why did she take a photo like this?

270
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,241
NURSE YU

271
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,872
What's going on? Where are you?

272
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,165
<i>I'm just outside your door,</i>

273
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,501
<i>but I can't go in</i>
<i>because I'm so scared of you.</i>

274
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,253
<i>Mr. Ma's appointments</i>
<i>are booked on every Thursday.</i>

275
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,006
<i>Mr. Park Sang-cheol called again</i>
<i>saying he wants an appointment,</i>

276
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,758
<i>but I talked him out of it.</i>

277
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,760
<i>There are other updates too.</i>

278
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,677
What are they?

279
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,638
<i>Shall I start with good news or bad news?</i>

280
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,056
Just say it.

281
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,100
<i>There's no update on the diamond thief.</i>

282
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,060
<i>The bank called to let you know</i>
<i>that you can't switch</i>

283
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,561
<i>to the loan with seven percent interest.</i>

284
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,231
<i>The windshields will be covered</i>
<i>by insurance, but the premium will go up.</i>

285
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,024
<i>Also, the landlord said</i>
<i>we can renew the contract</i>

286
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,984
<i>at a higher rent if we can't</i>
<i>pay more for the deposit.</i>

287
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,362
-All right. What's the good news?
-<i>I just told you.</i>

288
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,739
What? What did you say?

289
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,450
The landlord is okay with us
not paying more for the deposit.

290
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,785
<i>He'll raise our rent instead.</i>

291
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,211
What is this?

292
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,296
This could be a solution to our problem.

293
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,631
It's today.

294
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,222
SEUN UNIVERSITY ALUMNI REUNION

295
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,267
Everyone there must be pretty influential.

296
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,060
You should ask them for help.

297
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,813
I can't do it even if I wanted to
as I don't know anyone influential.

298
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,731
Why should I go there?

299
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,237
<i>Go ahead and leave me!</i>

300
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,449
Get out of my life, you jerk!

301
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,537
I turned that clueless guy...

302
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,914
into a decent man by feeding him good food

303
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,334
and buying him expensive designer clothes.

304
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,961
How can he dump me?

305
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,547
-Fried chicken is...
-I can't believe he two-timed me.

306
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,466
I need 4,000 won more.

307
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,012
-She's just a friend?
-I need two more customers.

308
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,430
How dare you!

309
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,476
Don't get killed in an accident.
I hope you live a great life.

310
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,607
-You jerk...
-Is that a lump of gold?

311
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,359
-Gold?
-It's a big lump of gold.

312
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,777
It's very big and tall.

313
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,738
No one will know even if we cut out
and take a corner of it.

314
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,616
Are you talking about that thing,
by any chance?

315
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,868
That can't be.

316
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,914
We've been here for a while.
I can't believe you noticed it just now.

317
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,125
When I saw it, I thought
that humans must really love gold.

318
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,085
At first, I thought it was a temple.

319
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,339
However, I've never seen a god
that has a temple like that

320
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,258
anywhere in the Land of the Sky,
Land of Earth, and Land of Water.

321
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,010
Here, gold is like a god.

322
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,514
Let's go.

323
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,980
Hang in there for just a bit longer.

324
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,942
I'll regain my power soon.
That's what my gut is telling me.

325
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,278
When that happens, the first thing
I'll do is make the gold you lost.

326
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,039
Namsuri.

327
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,376
I know why you're turning into an idiot.

328
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,546
I can live without much difficulty,
even in this situation,

329
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,592
thanks to your dedication.
I know that, of course.

330
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,012
You didn't actually think
I'd say that, did you?

331
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,525
Mura...

332
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,402
It's Mura.

333
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,529
Namsuri.

334
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,323
Namsuri.

335
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,535
-Namsuri!
-Yes!

336
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,538
-Mura is over there.
-Pardon me?

337
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,873
-Where?
-Over there!

338
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,836
Where?

339
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,552
SEUN UNIVERSITY ALUMNI REUNION

340
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,511
Hey,

341
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,263
are you really not coming?

342
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,472
<i>Why should I go there?</i>

343
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,266
<i>All of them will treat me like an oddball.</i>

344
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,935
It won't be any better for me.
Why am I attending this thing?

345
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,187
Oh, right. I'm here because I need money.

346
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,565
<i>How much do you need?</i>
<i>I can lend you one or two million.</i>

347
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,317
Forget it. Just buy yourself
some candy with it.

348
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,943
<i>Today is a good day for you. Cheer up.</i>

349
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,154
<i>I see that luck is coming your way.</i>

350
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,199
All right. You have such great instincts.

351
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,493
Gosh, seriously.

352
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,662
It could've been
at the school's assembly hall.

353
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,457
Why did they have to pick
this hotel on a hill? Darn it.

354
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,083
<i>You're turning into a foul mouth.</i>

355
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,003
Why don't you try walking up
this hill in high heels?

356
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,214
I dressed up because I heard people
are nicer to you when you look nice.

357
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,052
Hey, I've run out of oxygen.

358
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,971
<i>Wait. If you see Shin Ja-ya today,</i>
<i>you should avoid her.</i>

359
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,892
Gosh, my feet are killing me.

360
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,494
Why did they have to pick this hotel?
This is ridiculous.

361
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,708
Ms. Yun.

362
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,551
Unbelievable.

363
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,268
Just a second, please.

364
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,910
I'm going up there too.

365
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,371
If I offer you a ride
because it's on my way anyway,

366
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,081
would you tell me
to mind my business again?

367
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,249
Yes.

368
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,669
-Well, I mean--
-I see.

369
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,588
I knew you'd say that.

370
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,512
Wait, that's not what I meant.

371
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,483
He must be doing that on purpose.

372
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,237
I think he's trying to provoke me.

373
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,992
<i>If you don't accept me,</i>
<i>you'll go through everything.</i>

374
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,333
Excuse me, sir.

375
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,252
Yes?

376
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,464
Some people say the opposite
of what they feel.

377
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,216
-Pardon?
-For example,

378
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,636
their "It's fine" means "It isn't fine."

379
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,431
"I don't want it" means "I do want it."

380
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,476
"I'm fine" means "Please help."

381
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,604
Really?

382
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,815
Then that doctor...

383
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,529
Not her.

384
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,157
She seems very sure of her feelings.

385
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,369
I thought you had given up.

386
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,412
I had.

387
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,248
But she begged for forgiveness
and pleaded that I come.

388
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,251
-When?
-A few days ago.

389
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:09,382
Come to me if you change your mind.

390
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,634
<i>Has she been awakened then?</i>

391
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,093
No.

392
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,056
I think she was moved by me.

393
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,558
I'm the only one who trusts you.

394
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,938
Do you think it's easy
to win someone's trust?

395
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,359
How great is it to have someone
who trusts you?

396
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,029
That's...

397
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,823
who you are.

398
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,869
-Open the door.
-Yes, My Lord.

399
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,704
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

400
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,958
What?

401
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,502
They're closed today.

402
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,298
Nurse Yu. The doctor
isn't coming back today, right?

403
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,176
No. She went to her college reunion.

404
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,220
She'll be back late. Why?

405
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,763
Do you want to see the nurse?

406
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,557
He's working at my store right now.

407
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,724
It's okay.

408
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,898
It feels nice to visit the school
once in a while.

409
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,026
What school? It's at Grand Park Hotel.

410
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,570
They're all rich.

411
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,821
Should we come back tomorrow?

412
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:15,949
Let's go.

413
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,371
The bus goes there too.
Why must we always take expensive taxis?

414
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,540
We live day-to-day.

415
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,292
We can't survive like this.

416
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,934
So-a.

417
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,312
-Hi, Ji-won.
-<i>Hi.</i>

418
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,522
What's gotten into you?

419
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,317
You never come to reunions or gatherings.

420
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,526
That's true.

421
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,362
I just felt like coming.

422
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,114
How are things?

423
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,199
Rumor has it your clinic is struggling.

424
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,076
-Stop it.
-Yes.

425
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,997
What's with the flowers?

426
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,458
I have to show my appreciation to a donor

427
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,002
for their donation to our hospital.

428
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,587
It's the hospital director's orders.

429
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,047
Really?

430
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,216
Who is it that the director sent flowers?

431
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,428
He's the biggest individual donor
among alums.

432
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,846
Every year too.

433
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,224
He donates a lot and helps people
in need a lot too.

434
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,436
He's been supporting young entrepreneurs
since last year.

435
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,271
I hear he's doing it all personally.

436
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,315
Young entrepreneurs?

437
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,318
Darn it.

438
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,446
Perfect, right? He's two years older
and majored in business management.

439
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,448
He was there for one year
and transferred to Yale.

440
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,700
He came back and graduated early
after a year and a half.

441
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,079
It is awkward for both sides
to act like alumni.

442
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,747
He isn't close to any alum either.

443
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,041
I hear he's very secretive.

444
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,834
He's single too.

445
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,630
His face, body, and heart.
They all sparkle.

446
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,928
Maybe he's a complete fake.

447
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,971
No way. Not him.

448
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,390
No?

449
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,148
Would you be able to say this
to someone's face?

450
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,236
"Instead of bothering the bank staff
regarding your interest rate,

451
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,947
you should work harder
to earn money on your own."

452
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,281
Could you?

453
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,491
What?

454
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,206
The devil is in the details.

455
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,583
People like that are the ones

456
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,920
who'd insist on getting you to pay
for windshield wipers.

457
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,964
They're numb to others' pain.

458
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,966
Who knows? That may be a mask.

459
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,137
Do you know him personally?

460
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,305
How would she know him?

461
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,600
Your clinic really must be struggling.

462
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,103
I mean, you're all twisted inside.

463
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,479
-Hey, stop.
-Hey, Hee-young.

464
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,273
Are you talking behind my back?

465
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,317
Ms. Yun. Are your feet okay?

466
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,822
Do you know each other?

467
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,950
Yes. We know each other
well enough to talk...

468
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,493
behind the other's back.

469
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,163
She's a bank VIP, so we discuss
our interest rates openly.

470
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,498
-VIP?
-VIP?

471
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,501
She broke my windshield wipers by mistake.

472
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,336
I don't care about her reimbursing me,

473
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,590
but she can't rest until she pays for it.

474
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,176
That's our relationship.

475
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,471
-That's your relationship.
-That's your relationship.

476
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,213
What was that? Were you playing
the knight in shining armor?

477
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,672
I didn't know you were an alum.

478
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,883
-Had I known--
-If you had, what?

479
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,718
-You'd lend me money?
-Sorry?

480
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,553
<i>Are you insane?</i>

481
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,848
Sorry.

482
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,350
I'm drunk.

483
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,560
I jumped straight to the point
without thinking.

484
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,396
Did you come here to borrow money?

485
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,570
You're very unique.

486
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,783
It's common courtesy not to ask that,
even if you think it.

487
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,620
Yes. I'm going to start asking around
once I sober up.

488
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,373
-Why did you follow me out?
-I did not.

489
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,582
I have somewhere else to be.

490
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,919
-Is that Ja-ya?
-No one else compares.

491
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,128
-Ja-ya.
-You look pretty.

492
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,046
-Hi.
-Hi.

493
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,756
-You made it.
-Hello.

494
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,133
-Hi.
-You look so pretty.

495
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,553
-How have you been?
-Why are you so late?

496
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,514
I'll get going now.

497
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,516
There's someone I don't want to see.

498
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,893
Same goes for me. Good day.

499
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,604
You look so pretty.

500
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,912
Look who's here.

501
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,921
-Hi--
-<i>Look who's here.</i>

502
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,466
It's the Three-Second Beauty
from Seun Medical School.

503
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,510
I gave her that nickname.

504
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,637
-<i>It's the Three-second Beauty.</i>
-She may seem like a beauty,

505
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,973
but after three seconds,
you realize she's just a beggar.

506
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,644
<i>I gave her that nickname.</i>

507
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,355
<i>She may look like a beauty,</i>
<i>but after three seconds, you realize...</i>

508
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,648
-Oh my.
-<i>...she's just a beggar.</i>

509
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,608
Look at her.

510
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:45,737
Are you scowling at my roses?

511
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,573
-No.
-Yes, you are.

512
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,283
<i>Are you scowling...</i>

513
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,785
-You're jealous because I got this...
<i>-...at my roses?</i>

514
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,872
-...from a fan.
-<i>Yes, you are.</i>

515
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,625
-Ja-ya.
-<i>You're jealous because...</i>

516
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,835
-You still can't pronounce properly?
-<i>...I got this from a fan.</i>

517
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,004
You still can't pronounce
your words properly?

518
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,591
I see you talk like that
on TV at times too.

519
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,134
Don't do that, baby.

520
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,429
And stop using our school name.

521
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,430
Why, you...

522
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,016
<i>Why, you...</i>

523
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,768
Say my name properly.

524
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,353
I did. Shin Ja-ya.

525
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,854
-<i>Say my name properly.</i>
-Shin Ja-ya!

526
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,105
Shin Ja-ya.

527
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,857
Oh, Shin Ja-ya.

528
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,525
Shin Ja-ya?

529
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,194
Don't be like that.

530
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,863
Later. It was good seeing you.

531
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,199
-That's so funny.
-Is that really her name?

532
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,200
Is your dad...

533
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,452
not back yet?

534
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,957
-<i>Is your dad not back yet?</i>
-You know, your dad who went to volunteer

535
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,875
in Somalia or somewhere ridiculous

536
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,169
-and never came back.
-<i>In Somalia or somewhere...</i>

537
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,839
Guys, do you know how great
a person her dad is?

538
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:51,386
He used to bring in all the homeless
and orphans from the streets,

539
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,137
-feed them, wash them,
-<i>Do you know...</i>

540
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,306
-dress them, and teach them.
<i>-...how great a person her dad is?</i>

541
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,726
-He was a real angel.
-<i>Dress them, feed them,</i>

542
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,479
-<i>and teach them.</i>
-An angel without wings.

543
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,356
<i>He was a real angel.</i>

544
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,359
-I think she was a junior in high school.
-<i>An angel without wings.</i>

545
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,403
There was an earthquake
somewhere in Africa,

546
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,154
so he left to go volunteer.

547
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,864
<i>I think she was a junior in high school.</i>

548
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:16,828
We went to the same junior high
and high school, so I know her well.

549
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,871
What a great man.

550
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,957
-<i>We went to the same...</i>
-A great man?

551
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,792
<i>...junior high and high school.</i>

552
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,378
Yes, he was a great man.

553
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,213
He had such conviction...

554
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,174
that he sacrificed his family

555
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,052
-for the greater good of mankind.
<i>-Yes, he was a great man.</i>

556
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,390
<i>He had such conviction</i>
<i>that he sacrificed his family</i>

557
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,017
<i>for the greater good of mankind.</i>

558
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,934
What?

559
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,107
<i>What?</i>

560
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,693
You. Stop talking!

561
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,197
Why would she do that to the flowers?

562
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,712
Hey. Give me my flowers!

563
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,424
She ripped her blouse.

564
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,968
-She's gone too far.
-What's with her?

565
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,928
-Why would she do that?
-Oh, no.

566
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,638
Are you done?

567
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,849
Let me talk now.

568
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,061
Tell the others that I left.

569
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,355
Fine, I understand that goodwill
is ridiculed these days.

570
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,525
But you didn't have to confirm it
with your pretty lips.

571
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,819
Even if you don't possess virtues,

572
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,404
you should at least
try to look like you do.

573
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,449
You should try to spend
less time on social media.

574
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,867
You're obsessed with attention.

575
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,663
There was this term that is used
on social media.

576
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,584
An attention seeker.

577
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,922
It doesn't have
very nice connotations, though.

578
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,217
I'm really leaving now.

579
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,305
What? An attention seeker?

580
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,890
How dare you?

581
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,475
Stop right there!

582
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,775
-That's enough.
-Get out of my way.

583
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,280
Hey, So-a. Stop right there.

584
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,907
Let's go.

585
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,912
<i>Guys. Do you know how great</i>
<i>a person her dad is?</i>

586
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,875
<i>He used to bring in all the homeless</i>
<i>and orphans from the streets,</i>

587
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,710
<i>feed them, wash them,</i>

588
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,379
<i>dress them, and teach them.</i>

589
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,466
How dare you call me an attention seeker?
Stop right there!

590
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,384
You little--

591
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,428
What?

592
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,934
What are you doing?

593
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,064
-Who are you?
-What is your last name?

594
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,190
Is it Shim?

595
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,152
You don't know who I am?

596
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,653
It's me.

597
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,322
You look like someone I know
whose last name is Shim.

598
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,702
She's stuck-up and obnoxious.

599
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,995
Her last name is Shim.

600
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,164
Are you...

601
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,416
What are you talking about?

602
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,460
Gosh.

603
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,714
By the way,

604
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,217
why are you following my woman around
and bothering her?

605
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,429
What? Your woman?

606
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,346
Yes,

607
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,931
she belongs to me.

608
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,559
Ask for my permission
if you want to bother her.

609
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,894
Isn't that Ja-ya?

610
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,938
-It's Ja-ya.
-It is her.

611
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,195
So her last name is Ja?

612
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,864
I'm glad it's not Shim.

613
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,463
Why...

614
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,548
are you here?

615
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,966
I took a taxi.

616
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,847
The flowers...

617
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,892
didn't stop babbling.

618
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,897
It's driving me crazy.

619
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,743
I've warned you.

620
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,504
-Taxi.
-What?

621
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,720
Get in.

622
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,964
<i>That night, I ran recklessly.</i>

623
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,217
<i>It wasn't to catch my dad</i>
<i>who abandoned us.</i>

624
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,387
<i>It was to, instead of showing my pain,</i>

625
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,723
<i>gain the energy to live on.</i>

626
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,271
<i>As always,</i>

627
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,857
<i>my dad would go his own way.</i>

628
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,569
<i>I would have to rely on myself.</i>

629
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,614
<i>I realized this fact that night.</i>

630
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,580
<i>I tried to capture all the pain</i>
<i>I felt in my whole body.</i>

631
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,001
<i>I told myself it was all my dad's fault.</i>

632
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,671
<i>I decided to live on that hatred</i>
<i>and resentment from then on.</i>

633
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,343
<i>I ran to let my dad go.</i>

634
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,845
<i>It was my last resort.</i>

635
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,316
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

636
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,407
UNDYING CONNECTION
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN

637
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,314
Why did you bring me here?

638
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,446
You won't let me know where you live.
So I brought you to where I live.

639
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,489
You can tell me where you live
if you want.

640
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,370
Thank you for the jacket.

641
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,294
Where are you going?

642
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,630
You've received a god's help many times.
How can you just leave every time?

643
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,340
What do humans call it again?

644
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,134
-An ingrate.
-Exactly.

645
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,595
Are you an ingrate?

646
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,356
I'll work and pay the bills.

647
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,108
Mura will pay me later.

648
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,944
-Next.
-I have to work.

649
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,824
It's an electronic notice board.

650
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,578
It was probably a news program.

651
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,541
Maybe the person happened to be
caught on camera on the street

652
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,627
or was interviewed.

653
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,380
Are you sure you can recognize the person?

654
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,551
I would recognize my dear Mura
even with my eyes closed.

655
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,472
-So it's a girl.
-She's a goddess.

656
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,647
If there are no electronic notice boards
in your world, what is there?

657
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:09,610
Water, wind, trees, the sky,

658
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,737
mountains,

659
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,450
fish, air, and birds.

660
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,702
Is that all?

661
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,998
You said it's a world of deities.
We have those here too.

662
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,584
Those you have here are all fake.

663
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,379
It's such a relief
that the world of humans

664
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,005
wasn't included in the world of deities.

665
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,092
To think the deities' world
would've ended up like this...

666
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,677
All right.

667
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,055
-You can hold my arm.
-Sorry?

668
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,894
I'm fine.

669
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,817
It's a god's generosity...

670
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,819
and duty.

671
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,271
You still don't see her?

672
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,401
That thing is visually so distracting.

673
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,197
The more distracted people are,
the better products sell.

674
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,206
I wish you were actually a god.

675
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,879
Don't they have the power
to make anything happen?

676
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,799
Can you make that become mine?

677
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,885
If you faithfully carry out
your duties as my servant,

678
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,887
I can certainly make that thing for you.

679
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,847
You can make it?

680
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,977
-That too?
-Yes.

681
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,313
All I need to do is snap my fingers.

682
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,318
Then can you make that too?

683
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,571
-Sure thing.
-Then how about that bridge?

684
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,990
Of course.

685
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,533
What about the river?

686
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,993
That's a piece of cake.

687
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,203
Then what about that tree?

688
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,331
I can even make gold for you.

689
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,582
Gold?

690
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,879
Gosh, my heart is racing.

691
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,757
I want to become richer
than Sheikh Mansour.

692
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,550
-Make me some gold now.
-Right now, I can't.

693
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,303
I told you I'm in a bit of a situation.

694
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:42,930
Right.

695
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,313
There she is.

696
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,191
I see her.

697
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,526
You do?

698
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,864
That woman?

699
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,658
I told you that she's a goddess.

700
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,079
Well,

701
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,456
I guess you can call her a goddess.

702
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,209
She's Hye-ra, a famous actress
who is known for her divine beauty.

703
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,213
Hye-ra?

704
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,260
I guess that's her name here.

705
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,554
Everyone worships her beauty.

706
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,305
You're not the only one who thinks that.

707
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,850
You're right. She is certainly radiant.

708
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,227
She has this presence about her
that can't be hidden.

709
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,732
Right. Think about it, though.

710
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,276
Will someone who's so extraordinary

711
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,862
be willing to meet you?

712
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,864
Don't you worry.

713
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,491
I'm her lord and her king.

714
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,659
Well...

715
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,078
If you take me
to that castle where Mura is,

716
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,705
your duty will be fulfilled.

717
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,458
It means that you'll no longer
have to live as my servant.

718
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,379
You still don't want to do it?

719
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,016
<i>I'm here. I'm actually here.</i>

720
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,768
<i>What should I do now?</i>

721
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,228
I wish Namsuri was here.

722
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,774
It's too bad he had to work.

723
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,318
<i>Can I really be doing this?</i>

724
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,236
<i>Gosh, is this okay?</i>

725
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,491
Thanks for your help.
You could've been a better servant,

726
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,868
but Mura will bestow a great award
upon you for what you did today.

727
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,328
When my situation improves,

728
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,663
I'll also give you everything
you mentioned yesterday.

729
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,332
You may leave.

730
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,210
Hold on a second.

731
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,721
-Well... do you really have to go?
-You still don't believe me, do you?

732
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,057
I want to show you
what will happen in there,

733
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,351
but Mura hates humans
as much as I do, especially women.

734
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,895
I'm doing this for your sake.
You should leave.

735
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,814
Wait, hold on. That's not what I meant.

736
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,026
This isn't Hye-ra's place.

737
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,531
It's not her place, but...

738
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,242
Yes.

739
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,537
You need a reality check.

740
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,714
He told me to leave.

741
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,174
I did my best. Conscience?

742
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:09,428
There's nothing wrong with my conscience.
Stop saying weird things.

743
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:16,727
What? Come to think of it,
I haven't been hearing those sounds.

744
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,523
Great. My conscience has been restored.
Perfect.

745
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,983
I should get going.

746
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,695
Gosh, no!

747
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,531
I can't leave.

748
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,207
I guess that car broke down.

749
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,254
It's that doctor.

750
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,523
What is wrong with me?

751
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,360
Why on earth can't I leave?

752
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,460
Her place is pretty nice.

753
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,046
I should take a warm bath first.

754
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,007
I'm hungry too. No, that's impossible.

755
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,928
Her servants are well trained.

756
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,724
Sir, are you looking for someone?
I'll help you.

757
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,309
I can find her myself.

758
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,687
I want to surprise her.

759
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,398
Sure, have a great time.

760
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,567
What was that about?
Why did he talk to me so casually?

761
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,319
She must be close by.

762
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,696
I can feel it.

763
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,410
You're not sick, and you're probably
not here to see me either.

764
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,038
Why would I come all the way here
to see you?

765
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,456
You're right.

766
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,501
I got the wrong idea and overreacted.

767
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,588
But why are you gushing out
exhaust fumes in front of my hotel?

768
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,298
That I want to know.

769
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,843
Why are you saying this hotel is yours...

770
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,387
I guess it is.

771
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,435
Well... I'm leaving.

772
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,399
By any chance,

773
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,402
do you happen to know
if the actress, Hye-ra,

774
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,405
would be here today?
She won't be here, right?

775
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,199
Hye-ra? You mean our model?

776
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,883
My gosh, sir.

777
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,302
You know what my gorgeous actress is like.

778
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,396
<i>Mura.</i>

779
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,741
It's been a long time, Mura.

780
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,412
Hye-ra must be doing
a photo shoot right now.

781
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,914
What did you just say?

782
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,874
What's the matter?

783
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,542
My gosh!

784
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,756
No!

785
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,808
Let go!

786
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,936
Mura! It's me, Habaek.

787
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,356
Mura! Have I become unrecognizable?

788
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,899
I'm in a bind.

789
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,485
Something went wrong on my way here,
and I lost the map.

790
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,445
That's not the only thing I lost!

791
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,280
There are so many crazy people.

792
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,784
Isn't he that guy who pestered you

793
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:04,121
to give him your autograph on his forehead
at your signing last week?

794
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,580
How dare you touch me?

795
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,041
No, he's not that guy.

796
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,211
By the way, that man is so handsome.

797
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,213
Too bad.

798
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,510
I'm really sorry, Hye-ra.

799
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,512
Those are not the right shoes.

800
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,556
Finish it up quickly.

801
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,891
You punk!

802
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,732
Come here.

803
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,944
What is going on?

804
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,156
Hye-ra, you should get out of here.

805
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,532
Do your job properly.

806
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,491
Okay.

807
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,120
My goodness!

808
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,582
Gosh, what's he thinking?

809
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,422
Wait! Hold on, please.
Just a second, please.

810
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,466
Wait. He's a patient of mine.

811
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,094
I'll explain everything.
Please let go of him!

812
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,929
-I said, let go of him.
-Goodness!

813
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,101
My apologies.

814
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,605
Get away from my servant.

815
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,075
-Are you okay?
-Stop!

816
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,212
We'll take care of it, so...

817
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,360
Sir.

818
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,987
-Call the agency.
-Okay.

819
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,078
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

820
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,580
You should talk it out.

821
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,332
Why did you hit him?

822
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,667
Who are you?

823
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,255
-I'm his guardian.
-His guardian?

824
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,179
I hit him because he deserved it.

825
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,847
He's just getting what he deserves.

826
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,850
No one deserves to be hit.

827
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,560
He shoved our bodyguards.

828
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,356
Look here. People may say
you are a goddess,

829
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,358
but you're just human.

830
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,236
Once a flower blooms, it wilts and dies.

831
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,363
You think you'll stay beautiful forever,
right?

832
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,825
No. Don't be shocked
when you become a wrinkly old woman,

833
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,660
and take care of your mind.

834
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,376
Come see me.
I'll give you a celebrity discount.

835
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,046
Let's go.

836
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,132
Let's go.

837
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,308
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH
DOCTOR YUN SO-A

838
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:13,852
Get in.

839
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,563
Why'd you get involved?
She would've stopped.

840
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,772
Why, you...

841
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,066
You made a mistake.

842
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,568
Mura is a true goddess.

843
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,570
She is a flower that will not wilt or die.

844
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,447
Naturally, she won't grow old.

845
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,495
I said I was your guardian.

846
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,998
For the first time ever,
I wanted to remove you

847
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:35,957
from your world.

848
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,461
But you don't seem to want...

849
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,088
or have any desire to leave.

850
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,965
You and I live in different worlds.

851
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,183
Fine. Do you really want to meet a god?

852
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,476
I must.

853
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,435
Fine.

854
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,567
Hey, Yeom-mi.

855
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,196
The patient the doctor brought
must be a big fan of Hye-ra's.

856
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,282
There was a small incident,
but it ended without any problems.

857
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,909
The patient Ms. Yun brought?

858
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,328
Yes. But I think that patient

859
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,289
was the man we saw yesterday
outside Grand Park Hotel.

860
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,457
Really?

861
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,256
She must use very unique
treatment methods.

862
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,802
She seems very devoted to her patients.

863
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,639
She's just a hater.
It's nothing new. Forget it.

864
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,183
He assaulted one of our people too,

865
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,684
so he wouldn't complain, right?

866
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,936
If he does,

867
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,982
we can complain too.

868
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,193
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

869
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,611
Shut up.

870
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,202
Rest up. I'll come back
when things are ready.

871
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,248
Let's take a ten-minute break.
Take a break.

872
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,513
-Where are you?
-Shanghai.

873
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,889
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

874
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,558
I want to fly.

875
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,560
<i>This isn't the time to be flying.</i>

876
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,438
Hearing you say that,
I guess it is time to fly.

877
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,189
-<i>He's here.</i>
-Who?

878
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,150
-Habaek is here!
-What?

879
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,192
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

880
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,278
He showed up looking like a beggar.

881
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,447
Did the red water
finally come to the Land of Water?

882
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,700
-What do we do?
-Calm down, miss.

883
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,285
He'll come for me too, then.

884
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,327
I doubt it.

885
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,081
That idiot lost the map.

886
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,125
-What?
-He said that isn't all he lost,

887
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,586
but I don't know what he meant.
I kicked him out.

888
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,088
Don't forget.

889
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,466
You and I are accomplices

890
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,344
with regard to the sacred stone. Got it?

891
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,560
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH

892
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,604
How dare you bring a girl with you?

893
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,274
The first thing you did in
the human world was seduce a girl?

894
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,318
Habaek is here.

895
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,989
I was getting bored anyway.
This should be interesting.

896
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,951
Shall we switch over to a mystery,
thriller, and suspense movie?

897
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,872
Okay.

898
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:40,016
Is a woman who knows a god really in here?

899
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:43,311
Yes. I think she meets
with a god quite often.

900
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,856
That can't be possible.

901
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,203
It wouldn't be surprising
for Lord Biryeom.

902
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,497
He was like that when he was
in the Land of the Sky too.

903
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,915
Plus, she's a woman.

904
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,042
Lord Biryeom likes women
more than anything.

905
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,255
-You wait here.
-Yes, My Lord.

906
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,049
I'll think about
why Lady Mura is snubbing you.

907
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,884
-What? Snubbing?
-Let's go.

908
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,487
Why is it so empty?

909
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,240
The units haven't been sold yet.

910
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,243
It's been a year,
but it's still in this state.

911
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,037
Like someone who can read
into other people's futures,

912
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,039
but have no clue about their own.

913
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,000
-What does that mean?
-We're here.

914
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,174
Here.

915
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,931
Her name is Jo Yeom-mi. She's my friend.

916
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,075
He's Guy B, whom you told me about,

917
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,411
and you're Girl A,
the one struggling with her conscience?

918
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:26,247
You're the one who heard voices
about a curse.

919
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,790
Guy B says he's a god.

920
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,001
Let him talk to you.

921
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,253
He insists he must meet a god.

922
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,048
You are the closest thing I know to a god.

923
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,637
I know. But he refuses medical help,
which we studied.

924
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,222
So give him a consultation

925
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:47,060
and figure out
what kind of a world he lives in.

926
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,271
I think he's for real.

927
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,732
He should be a host to a god.

928
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,650
What?

929
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,777
You look a lot like him.

930
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,363
-I heard from So-a.
-Where's Biryeom?

931
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,156
Bring him right now.

932
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,409
-I don't know who that is.
-You don't?

933
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,997
Then is Joodong the one you met?

934
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,874
Now, who's Joodong?

935
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,003
I came because she said
you meet with a god.

936
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:18,675
I do, but the god that I serve
is neither Biryeom nor Joodong.

937
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,843
No? Then whom?

938
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,847
Do you meet with one of the useless
minor deities that fell here?

939
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,683
Not a minor deity, either.

940
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,102
My god's name...

941
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,938
is Sigmund Freud.

942
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,504
Okay. Why don't you talk first?

943
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,339
You said you heard already.

944
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,136
That servant never does anything right.

945
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,473
Listen, lowly human.

946
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,726
I'm the next emperor of deities,

947
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,478
the next king of the Land of Water,
and the god of water.

948
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,397
I am Habaek.

949
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,289
<i>Mr. Park Sang-cheol called,</i>
<i>saying it'll be the last time for real.</i>

950
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,415
<i>He sounded resolute.</i>

951
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,459
What does he want?

952
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:42,550
Call him and schedule a meeting
for tomorrow.

953
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,186
<i>I think he's for real.</i>

954
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,438
<i>He should be a host to a god.</i>

955
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,107
<i>You and I live in different worlds.</i>

956
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,486
Whether it's this side or that side,

957
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,031
he lives in a different world.

958
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,894
It ends here.

959
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,356
You don't have to care anymore.

960
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,194
You have Vanuatu.

961
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,204
What the...

962
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,668
QUACK

963
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,840
-How did it go?
-I'll text you Professor Hwang's number.

964
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,176
He's the director ofÂ a psychiatric
hospital in Gangwon Province now.

965
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,512
He clearly falls within
Professor Hwang's expertise.

966
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,223
He was the one person who understood me.

967
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,433
I see why you struggled so much.

968
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,852
He's beyond what you can treat.

969
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,770
-<i>Send him there.</i>
-Hey, Yeom-mi.

970
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,772
<i>I signed up for a cooking class.</i>
<i>It starts today.</i>

971
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,357
I'm late, so I'm out. Bye.

972
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,316
Hey!

973
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,361
Shoot.

974
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,296
Excuse me.

975
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,808
Were you toying with me?

976
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,312
No, that's not it.

977
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,479
You foolish human.

978
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,025
Don't you believe me?

979
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,653
-No, that's not it.
-You may go.

980
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,739
I'll really let you go this time.

981
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,345
It's just that I didn't believe things
that are unbelievable.

982
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,180
This was the best I could do for you.

983
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,098
How do you differentiate...

984
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,100
what is true from what is not?

985
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,519
To you, truth is believing
what you want to believe.

986
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,190
Because that is easier.
It is less difficult.

987
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,069
That's how you close your eyes
to certain truths.

988
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,283
<i>Your dad abandoned us.</i>

989
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,243
<i>That's what you should assume.</i>

990
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,290
You don't know anything.

991
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,391
<i>To you, truth is believing</i>
<i>what you want to believe.</i>

992
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,894
<i>Because that is easier.</i>
<i>It is less difficult.</i>

993
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,440
<i>That's how you close your eyes</i>
<i>to certain truths.</i>

994
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,903
<i>Your dad abandoned us.</i>

995
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,655
<i>That's what you should assume.</i>

996
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,365
<i>Why is the truth...</i>

997
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,867
<i>so important?</i>

998
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,117
Lord Habaek was right.

999
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,619
This really does make time fly.

1000
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,623
I wonder how it's going.

1001
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:26,876
Should I text?

1002
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:30,004
That's right. He can't read.

1003
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:34,550
What is that?

1004
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,900
NAMSURI

1005
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,664
-What is it?
-Why is Ms. Descendant doing that?

1006
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,416
-What?
-Why is Ms. Descendant

1007
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,709
fighting some man on the roof?

1008
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,544
What are you talking about?

1009
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,462
Oh, no.

1010
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:12,463
She's...

1011
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:14,840
Why, that jerk...

1012
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,678
Let go.

1013
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,472
What are you saying, you idiot?

1014
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,682
<i>Oh, no. He keeps pushing her.</i>

1015
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,392
<i>He's pushing her!</i>

1016
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,894
<i>She's falling!</i>

1017
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,284
<i>It must be fate.</i>

1018
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:27,163
<i>The person who saves her life...</i>

1019
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,500
What are you?

1020
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,169
I told you.

1021
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,921
I'm a god.

1022
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,884
<i>It must be fate.</i>

1023
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,491
<i>-Your power...</i>
<i>-No way.</i>

1024
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,161
-Long time no see, So-a.
-<i>No way!</i>

1025
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,621
<i>Don't fall for me.</i>

1026
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:09,955
Who are you, really?

1027
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,958
There's no way out if you fall for me.

1028
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,210
<i>I want to kill him.</i>

1029
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,879
<i>I met a real god today.</i>

1030
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,130
<i>I am the real god.</i>

1031
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,674
<i>Why does he keep leeching off of me?</i>

1032
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,301
-<i>I'm sorry.</i>
-Want to know a secret?

1033
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:23,719
<i>I did nothing wrong.</i>

1034
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:24,970
I'm the victim.

1035
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,182
<i>-Who was he?</i>
<i>-How did he...</i>

1036
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,600
<i>Tell me!</i>
