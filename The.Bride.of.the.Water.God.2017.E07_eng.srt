1
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,862
So-a!

2
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,282
So-a!

3
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,710
So-a...

4
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,379
So-a!

5
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,382
So-a!

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,386
So-a!

7
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,847
My Lord!

8
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,492
Sit here.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,457
Wake up already.

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,003
-Why are you here?
-I'm off today.

11
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,298
I've been following you guys all day
because I was curious.

12
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,759
Why did you fight, by the way?

13
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,428
Hey.

14
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,641
Are you not going to thank me?

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,519
Fine, let's call it even.

16
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,492
She's so shy.

17
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,593
What are you so worried about?

18
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,846
It's nothing.

19
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,101
You look like you had
a near-death experience just now.

20
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,231
The customer before you said
he almost died four times this month.

21
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,649
-Four times?
-Yes.

22
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,693
In the end,

23
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,739
he said he came to accept it as his fate.

24
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,702
If it's really his fate,
I guess he could think like that.

25
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,371
You don't seem to understand what fate is.

26
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,497
Sorry?

27
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,001
Half of your fate, which has to do with
the length of your life, is unchangeable.

28
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,544
That's a given.

29
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,921
But the other half is different.

30
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,300
Depending on how one deals with
their fate, it's changeable.

31
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,553
So what I'm saying is that it is possible

32
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,013
to change your fate.

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,266
It's the same with driving a taxi.
Depending on the driver's skills,

34
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,269
your trip can be fast, slow,

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,979
comfortable, or uncomfortable.

36
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,690
At times, you can't get
to your destination.

37
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,610
Today, you met a good driver.

38
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,739
Your trip will be fast and safe.

39
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,625
Why are you laughing?

40
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,045
It feels like I've been watching
a romantic comedy all day.

41
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,880
It's not my favorite genre, though.

42
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,299
A romantic comedy? What do you mean?

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,843
You even had a fight at the end.
It's perfect.

44
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,471
So, why did you fight?

45
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,318
WHITE LOTUS HOUSE

46
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,494
Ms. Yun.

47
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,167
Something came up.

48
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,338
It's become a bit crumpled,
but you can still sign it.

49
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,631
Is something wrong?

50
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,383
No.

51
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,343
Let's sign it.

52
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,682
Right now.

53
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,895
Is someone against selling the land?

54
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,482
No. Not at all.

55
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,527
Keep this. I'll send you a new one.

56
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,280
-Let's just--
-We can't today.

57
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,990
I need the company's seal.

58
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,248
I was in such a hurry.
I didn't think about that.

59
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,167
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,421
Goodbye.

61
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,716
Are you kidding me?

62
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,509
Sorry?

63
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,012
You came all the way here.

64
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,306
Do you think I'll let you go like this?

65
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,861
Oh, my goodness!

66
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,654
Are you okay?

67
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,577
When your head is a mess,
physical labor is the cure.

68
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,619
You're right.

69
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,498
You seemed like a heartless person.

70
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,084
I didn't know you had a hobby like this.

71
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,336
That's prejudice.

72
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,213
A heartless person can love trees too.

73
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,593
Also, I have a healthy and pumping heart.

74
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,846
In any case,
you do seem like a cold person.

75
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,515
I wonder how you became
a successful businessperson.

76
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,063
I can read people's emotions if I want to.

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,190
I just try not to.

78
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,109
I see. Do you have
supernatural powers or something?

79
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,905
-Isn't it amazing?
-Sadly, not really.

80
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,115
There are many people like you around me.

81
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,119
I know a person who can teleport,

82
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,663
a person who can make diamonds endlessly,

83
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,000
and a person who can master
anything just by seeing it once.

84
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,256
That person can transform as well.

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,634
-They're dangerous.
-Right?

86
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,859
Give it to me.

87
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,889
Thank you.

88
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,315
Of all hobbies, why do you like
to take care of trees?

89
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,321
Trees live longer than me.

90
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,200
Trees create a forest,
but they don't try to control it.

91
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,996
From grasses and insects to winds,

92
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,706
they embrace everything.

93
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,875
They live with other beings.

94
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,044
They offer things to others
to prove their existence.

95
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,466
I was right, wasn't I?

96
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,968
When you're exhausted,
you forget everything.

97
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,639
What was it?

98
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,143
This is strange.

99
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,731
-Why do I want to tell you everything?
-It's because I'm a stranger.

100
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,649
A stranger?

101
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,653
If you just talk to yourself,
it won't get you anywhere.

102
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,074
This is strange.

103
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,328
It shouldn't make sense, but it does.

104
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,831
Just imagine you're talking to a tree.

105
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,295
I just...

106
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,510
made a common mistake that everyone makes.

107
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,848
I relied on someone without realizing it.

108
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,267
I started to have expectations.

109
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,732
Most of all, I revealed my feelings,
which was the worst of it all.

110
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,277
You probably thought you could
do that with that person.

111
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,654
No.

112
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,199
I shouldn't have.

113
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,162
He's going to leave anyway.

114
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,291
To be precise, he's not a person.

115
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,630
He's a bad person.

116
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,298
Sorry?

117
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,509
He's going to leave anyway.

118
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,596
But he stirred your heart.

119
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,387
Thank you.

120
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,557
The farm is always open.

121
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,726
It's always short of hands too.

122
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,104
Mr. Shin.

123
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,651
I'd like to apologize
for being prejudiced against you.

124
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,988
Oh, my.

125
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,077
Bye.

126
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,461
<i>He is going to leave anyway.</i>

127
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,880
<i>But he stirred your heart.</i>

128
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,615
What are you doing here?

129
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,079
I was thinking about
how I can get my power back.

130
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,415
Let's go.

131
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,755
Did you go to see the land?

132
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,590
No.

133
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,717
Why not?

134
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,845
You acted as if you had
to go there immediately.

135
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,097
I don't have a driver's license, you know.

136
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,602
Bin has one.
You should've asked him to take you.

137
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,688
I told you that I can't trust him.

138
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,609
Then are we good now?

139
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,125
Are you still mad at me?

140
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,548
-I said I'd protect you because--
-I lied to you.

141
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,721
What I told you earlier in the day
was all a lie.

142
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,144
Humans are like that.

143
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,397
When people are angry,
they spew out whatever comes to mind.

144
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,569
I didn't mean it,
so please don't take it to heart.

145
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,238
I was just rambling on,
so you shouldn't take it seriously.

146
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,784
Don't worry.

147
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,828
I knew.

148
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,167
When you lie, it's so obvious.

149
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,095
<i>Where are you?</i>

150
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,889
-I'm working.
-<i>Where are you now?</i>

151
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll kill you if you show up here.

152
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,019
I'm the only one who has it tough.

153
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,564
Those in the Land of Earth seem to be
doing fine even without Judong.

154
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,734
And you don't even get in trouble
for slacking all the time.

155
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,694
<i>I have problems too.</i>

156
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,654
Water is the worst.

157
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,457
It's still like this even after
I tried to resuscitate it.

158
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,585
Soon, a day will come
when we'd have no choice but to give up.

159
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,047
We can't bring the dead back to life.

160
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,840
<i>Guess what I did all day.</i>

161
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,425
Do you actually think I'd be curious?

162
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,053
I followed Habaek around all day and...

163
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,138
Don't make me explode in jealousy.

164
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,306
Just do your work.

165
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,515
I saw Jugeollin.

166
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,693
Coming and going like the wind
is my specialty.

167
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,654
What happened?
Has Habaek found out everything?

168
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,698
I'm asking if he knows everything now.

169
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,492
Did Jugeollin tell him everything?

170
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,369
Jugeollin is really something.

171
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,454
He ran away like a nimble rat.

172
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,959
Is it really something
you should be that worried about?

173
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,710
Just find Judong as soon as possible.

174
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,546
We should send him back soon.
It's really stressing me out.

175
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,759
Then why are you looking for an apartment?

176
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,511
Aren't you planning to live with him?

177
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,388
I hope you find a nice place.

178
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,850
It doesn't look like Habaek
wants to go back soon anyway.

179
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,061
What? Why not?

180
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,026
All right, let's start with breathing.

181
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,070
Breathe in through your nose...

182
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,197
and breathe out.

183
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,994
Now, you're going to use
your right hand and left leg.

184
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,831
Put them over your left hand
and left foot, then twist.

185
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,083
Your palms must touch each other.

186
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,086
Then breathe in and out. Like this.

187
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,257
Oh, no, Ja-ya. Try to stay balanced.

188
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,592
Bend down more.

189
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,219
Keep going.

190
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,223
Now, release. That's it.

191
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,643
A morning live show approached us
saying that they want to use

192
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,895
the outdoor space at our resort
for their main segment.

193
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,981
They'd need the space for two hours

194
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,399
from 6 to 8 a.m.

195
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,776
What do those in the marketing team think?

196
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,280
They said that it won't really
help us promote our resort,

197
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,782
but they'll probably use Ms. Shin
to persuade us again.

198
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,869
Even yesterday, I was bombarded
with interview requests for you.

199
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,996
Thanks for your hard work.

200
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,875
How about the proposal
for the summer event?

201
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,877
I haven't received it.
Please check on it for me.

202
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,045
No problem.

203
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,713
One more thing. On my computer,

204
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,215
you'll find documents from Culture Space.

205
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,176
-Please email them to me.
-Sure.

206
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,643
CEO SHIN HU-YE

207
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,606
Hey!

208
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,818
-Mr. Min, where's Mr. Shin?
-He stepped out for a meeting.

209
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,403
Why is he always so busy?

210
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,281
If this is about the interview,
I thought I'd made it clear.

211
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,076
I know. You heartless people.

212
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,828
Forget about it. By the way,

213
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,333
why did Mr. Shin smirk at me earlier?

214
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,670
-He smirked?
-Yes, he did.

215
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,633
It totally creeped me out.

216
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,636
-Do you know why?
-I can't read his mind,

217
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,222
but I would've laughed
because you looked funny.

218
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,598
What?

219
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,435
You were twisting your body.

220
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,437
Anyone would've laughed
as it looked so funny.

221
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,524
-Hey, how dare you--
-Call me Mr. Min.

222
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,862
Hey, stop!

223
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,700
Did I really look funny?

224
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,160
That's not good.

225
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,830
MR. SHIN HU-YE

226
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,378
Hello?

227
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,504
Oh, no.

228
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,005
Did I call too early?

229
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,591
No.

230
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,636
<i>I have all paperwork ready.</i>
<i>Shall I schedule the meeting for Monday?</i>

231
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,391
Sure, that would be great.

232
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,685
Actually, let's just meet today.

233
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,771
-Pardon?
-Who knows what else will happen?

234
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,898
Let's just get it done.
I'll bring my company's seal.

235
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,234
Sure.

236
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>I'll see you later, then.</i>

237
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,071
<i>I have to stop by the farm</i>
<i>in the afternoon.</i>

238
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,532
<i>A rare flower seedling</i>
<i>I ordered has arrived.</i>

239
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,617
I see. Then I'll see you in the evening.

240
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,453
Why are you so excited? Who is it?

241
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,664
What are you doing here?

242
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,499
How did you even get in here?

243
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,756
My keys!

244
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,511
You're unbelievable.

245
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,847
-It was left in the door lock.
-What?

246
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,199
The fact that I left it there

247
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,452
and how you trespassed into my place
are two different things.

248
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,872
This is my place. What is the problem?

249
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,501
I've told you so many times,
yet you still don't get it.

250
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,215
What happened with the land?

251
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,720
Are you trying to sell the land
because of money?

252
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,639
Because you need money?

253
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,393
That's right. I wouldn't sell it
if the situation wasn't so bad.

254
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,728
Then do whatever you want.

255
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,356
-Sorry?
-Didn't you say

256
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,233
having a lot of money will make you happy?

257
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,527
Do as you wish.

258
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,662
By the way, whom were you
on the phone with just now?

259
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,914
You were smiling like an idiot.

260
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,040
You don't need to know.

261
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,206
-What?
-It was a guy, wasn't it?

262
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,376
-What did you say?
-It must've been a guy.

263
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,838
Your face has turned beet red,

264
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,048
and your heart is skipping beats.

265
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,054
You're breathing heavily.

266
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,683
Your eyes are shaking.

267
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,063
It was a man. You talked to a man.

268
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,940
It's just like in the movies.

269
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,408
What? What did he say?

270
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,957
<i>-What should we do?</i>
<i>-What do you mean?</i>

271
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,084
<i>We can take a taxi if there's no bus.</i>

272
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,378
<i>Not that.</i>

273
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,255
<i>Us.</i>

274
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,512
Where did you go
in the middle of the movie?

275
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,680
<i>Shall we burn everything?</i>

276
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,768
I probably have similar taste to you.

277
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,729
I can't stand romantic comedies.

278
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,773
I just saw something unbearable
in real life.

279
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,192
Where is my fruit drink?

280
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,610
I didn't-- Oh, gosh.

281
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,242
What are all these?

282
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,580
Lady Mura sent them because
she didn't like Lord Habaek's clothes.

283
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,751
I didn't talk to a guy.

284
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,211
Was it a girl?

285
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,756
It was a guy,

286
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,677
but I didn't blush
because I talked to a guy.

287
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,179
He's just...

288
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,476
Forget it.

289
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,894
It doesn't matter.

290
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,396
Let's just say so.

291
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,657
So did she talk to a guy or not?

292
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,991
She did.

293
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,329
Is it important?

294
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,960
Why did I try to explain myself?

295
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,003
What's the big deal?

296
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,631
I almost told him
he wants to buy the land.

297
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,509
<i>You may sell everything else,</i>

298
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,344
<i>but not the land.</i>

299
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,514
<i>Then do whatever you want.</i>

300
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,108
Why does he keep changing his mind?

301
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,734
It's so confusing.

302
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,530
<i>Didn't you say that having</i>
<i>a lot of money will make you happy?</i>

303
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,740
Does he...

304
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,828
want me to be happy? No way.

305
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,748
He's testing me. He's so sly.

306
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,510
-You're here.
-Who were they?

307
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,387
On your land,

308
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,307
Korean leopards' feces were found.

309
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,142
What was found?

310
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,060
Poop. Korean leopards' poop.

311
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,855
And?

312
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,816
Korean leopards died out

313
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,777
during the Japanese colonial era
and the Korean War.

314
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,905
The last one lived in Changgyeonggung,

315
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,573
and it died in 1973.

316
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,409
That was the end of Korean leopards.

317
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,745
And?

318
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,581
The Korean Leopard Preservation Council
is working with Russia

319
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,500
to resurrect Korean leopards.

320
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,879
Luckily, they found their poop
on your land.

321
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,590
My goodness. And?

322
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,510
They want you to keep the land
until their research is finished.

323
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,678
They heard about it
at the real estate agency.

324
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,180
Are you done?

325
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,848
Get out.

326
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,352
Korean leopards should be brought back.

327
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,312
Sang-yu.

328
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:27,317
I don't think Korean leopards
pooped only on my land.

329
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,988
Mr. Ma is coming
with his father today, right?

330
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,534
He canceled the appointment,
saying he was going on a trip.

331
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,787
There are no other appointments
scheduled today. Do you want to go home?

332
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,122
You're closing down the clinic soon
anyway.

333
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,625
Are you trying to be rebellious or funny?

334
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,756
Goodbye,

335
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,217
my sweet drunk.

336
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,845
Don't come to me again.

337
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,100
Don't ask the forest for direction.

338
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,646
Don't send your regards with the wind.

339
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,732
You were...

340
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,362
my everything. I'll remember you forever.

341
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,345
Breathe.

342
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,100
My goodness!

343
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,644
What is this?

344
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,527
How many times has it happened?

345
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,864
How can the king of romance
pass out before a kissing scene?

346
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,575
It's not like Hye-ra will eat him.

347
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,868
I know.

348
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,203
Is Hye-ra overpowering?

349
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,331
Can't he tell charismatic
from overpowering?

350
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,458
She's just charismatic.

351
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,668
Male actors keep passing out.

352
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,339
Hye-ra is not a bad actress.

353
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,425
-But they say she can't do romance.
-They say she's stiff.

354
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,969
They say there is no chemistry
between her and her partner.

355
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,180
They say she eats her partners.

356
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,181
Mr. Kim.

357
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,479
-Yes?
-What about my apartment?

358
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,980
Are you looking?

359
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,568
Of course, I'm looking
for a place for you.

360
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,738
You said it has to be
a penthouse with a view

361
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,823
and furniture that suits your taste.

362
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,702
Can you elaborate a little more?

363
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,832
You don't understand?

364
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,377
Why don't you understand?

365
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,547
Your lips.

366
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,967
Let me put some lipstick on you.
Something with more color.

367
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,021
Go have some steaks.

368
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,273
I hired a chef with three Michelin stars.

369
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,900
You're here.

370
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,236
Give that to me and go have your steaks.

371
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,532
Thank you.

372
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,335
You'll soon be only shooting movies
like <i>Amazons.</i>

373
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,462
Hye-ra.

374
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,466
You look so pretty.

375
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,429
By the way, the shooting is over.

376
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,180
The actor was sent to the hospital.

377
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,020
-Do you want to have a drink?
-I'm meeting someone.

378
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,940
Don't worry about him.

379
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,110
He has nothing else to do.
He follows me everywhere.

380
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,822
You have a good friend.

381
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,952
Our friendship is stronger
than anything in the world.

382
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,664
Friendship so strong
that it can even cut through steel.

383
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,752
A friend who you could even die for.

384
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,713
How can you find a friend like that?

385
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:22,093
After going through all kinds of things,
you become good friends.

386
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,599
I'm looking for a place to stay.

387
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,311
I see. Thanks to your long stay,

388
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,730
our resort has become famous.

389
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,523
I'm sorry it's so sudden.

390
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,026
Our marketing team will have
to work hard from now on.

391
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,698
I'm surprised someone can
have a normal conversation with you.

392
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,951
I'm surprised you said you were sorry too.

393
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,661
He's a nice guy.

394
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,790
He is strong to the strong
and weak to the weak.

395
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,957
What?

396
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,044
I didn't know you had standards like that.

397
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,296
You know nothing about me.

398
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,635
HABAEK

399
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,723
Habaek.

400
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,520
I'll be right there. Get ready.

401
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,897
Biryeom?

402
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,608
Don't tell him yet.

403
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,152
He's not trustworthy.

404
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,321
See you soon.

405
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,243
Why don't you tell Ms. Descendant?

406
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,410
It's our problem.

407
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,496
I don't want to drag her into it.

408
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,252
What was the conversation about?

409
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,380
Is it something only gods
from the Land of Water should know?

410
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,757
I feel left out.

411
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:44,926
You should go now.

412
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,972
Look.

413
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,017
If you keep doing this,
I might turn into a bad guy.

414
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,018
Whatever.

415
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,145
Fine.

416
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,415
What should I do
to make her want to be with me?

417
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,836
Should I bring that punk to her?

418
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,188
I'm so hungry.

419
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,903
Where am I supposed to go if I can't
settle into even the human world?

420
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,989
Gosh, I'm starving!

421
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,293
PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED DEITIES

422
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,254
ANNOUNCEMENT: OUR REGULAR BREAKFAST
GET-TOGETHER WILL BE HELD

423
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,849
This is my first time back here
since that day.

424
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,270
Why are we here?

425
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,273
Too much time has passed for us
to find any traces.

426
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,696
Did you say Judong asked you to come here
that day because something seemed odd?

427
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,697
Yes.

428
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,455
It's not that way. He went the other way
to pick up the sacred stone.

429
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,151
What's the matter?

430
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,367
What?

431
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,702
What is that?

432
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,790
I didn't think much of it
when I first saw it here,

433
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,752
but what Judong said bothers me.

434
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,425
-What does this look like to you?
-This... This is...

435
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,176
Blood.

436
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,429
But...

437
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,990
I do feel the energy of human blood,

438
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,575
but that's impossible.

439
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,619
Nothing of humans
can leave traces on this land.

440
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,539
I know.
It purifies itself of all human traces.

441
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,877
If it's not from the human world,

442
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,546
could it be from someone
from the divine realm?

443
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,673
Those from our realm
can leave traces here,

444
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,967
but none of us has blood.

445
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,512
Then what on earth...

446
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,390
is this?

447
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,906
We did it!

448
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,574
Is it done?

449
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,909
Don't move your hand.

450
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,120
There we go.

451
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,957
Is it done now?

452
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:47,960
It's done.

453
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,548
We're finished!

454
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,509
Gosh, my back hurts.

455
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,053
Gosh, my back hurts.

456
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,889
Thanks to you,
I could get it done quickly.

457
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,198
Grandma said you should
join us for noodles

458
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,950
if you're hungry.

459
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,702
You guys are having noodles today.

460
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,454
I'm so sorry.

461
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,916
I have to get going now because
I have an important appointment.

462
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,127
I see. That's like a promise.

463
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,963
It's important to keep promises.
You should get going, then.

464
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,383
Thank you for understanding.

465
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,678
Hold on a second.

466
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,933
Mr. Shin!

467
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,476
Mr. Shin!

468
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,313
Is there a bug on my arm? Is it a worm?

469
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,196
What kind of bug was it?

470
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,740
It had many legs. It made my skin sting.

471
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,742
You're okay now. Don't cry.

472
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,954
Don't cry, okay? All is well now.

473
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,499
It's okay. Stop crying. There.

474
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,877
Let's go, okay?

475
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,423
Yes, Ms. Yun.

476
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,058
Do you think it's related
to Judong's disappearance?

477
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,852
It does seem odd.

478
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,396
The lowly deities might know more
about this than we do.

479
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,940
-Will you keep this from Biryeom?
-Don't tell him yet.

480
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,859
I don't like that punk either.

481
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,321
He came up with the idea of
divine servants just to hurt you.

482
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,865
I don't even want to see him
when I think about that.

483
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:45,244
But he was born like that, you know.
There's nothing we can do about it.

484
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,750
I don't know why he got so nosy
and meddled like that back then.

485
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,046
By the way,

486
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,798
you do want to find Judong soon, right?

487
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,762
-What?
-Biryeom said something strange.

488
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,348
He told me that you probably
don't want to go back soon.

489
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,476
What did he mean by that?

490
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,492
Biryeom... was talking nonsense, right?

491
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,248
"I'd rather keep my mouth shut
if I have to lie."

492
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,959
That's you, Habaek.

493
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,544
You must know.

494
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,048
I lie to you often.

495
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,969
You've never lied to me, though.

496
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,637
Habaek,

497
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,555
do you know this?

498
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,851
Sometimes,
I wish you could just lie to me.

499
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,561
Do you know why?

500
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,147
It's because you're well aware
of the weight words carry.

501
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,442
Once you utter something,
you do your best to keep your word.

502
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,529
That's why I'm saying this.
Even if what Biryeom said is true,

503
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,698
-just lie to me and say it's not.
-Mura...

504
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,408
I don't want you
to fall for another human girl.

505
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,659
Mura.

506
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,869
I don't want you to remember the despair
and pain from the old days.

507
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,162
Mura, what...

508
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,998
What are you talking about?

509
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,750
Did I jump to conclusions?
I'll be relieved if it's not true.

510
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,633
With the dignity of the next king
and the authority of the ruler,

511
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,844
please punish me for my arrogance.

512
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,554
I'll gladly accept it.

513
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,396
DECLARATION OF INTENT
TO SELL REAL ESTATE PROPERTY

514
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,522
Please stamp your seal.

515
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,065
Sure.

516
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,159
<i>You may sell everything else,</i>
<i>but not the land.</i>

517
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,329
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

518
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,707
No.

519
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,627
<i>Then do whatever you want.</i>

520
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,715
Yes, he told me to do whatever I want.

521
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,682
This deal is finally done.

522
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,893
Do you know something, Ms. Yun?

523
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,480
I somehow ended up overseeing
this contract with you,

524
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,316
and those in the department
in charge think it's strange.

525
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,275
If...

526
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,445
If there's any misunderstanding,
I'll explain--

527
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,947
Sometimes,
explaining can make things worse.

528
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,617
And there are also things
you don't really need to explain.

529
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,286
Let's have dinner together
to celebrate closing this deal.

530
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,879
The land has been passed down
in your family for generations.

531
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,130
Don't you feel a bit sad?

532
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,008
It's a useless piece of land
that hasn't done my family any good,

533
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,385
so it's fine.

534
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,097
Your parents must be sad about it, though.

535
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,309
I can't ask my father's opinion
for a certain reason.

536
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,727
As for my mom...

537
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,401
My mom is dead,
so I can't ask her opinion either.

538
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,529
I'm so sorry. I assumed that--

539
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,489
I know, right?

540
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,659
I guess that's why you can never
assume anything about anyone.

541
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,163
You look like you were born
with a silver spoon in your mouth,

542
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,749
but it's probably not the case.
I have to be right about it.

543
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,209
Yes, you're right.

544
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,586
I'm an orphan.

545
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,758
I don't know who my mother is,

546
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,928
and my father abandoned me
after abusing me.

547
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,939
Just leave it.
I'll ask the waiter to bring a new one.

548
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,448
Aren't you hungry? Do you want to eat?
There are great restaurants in this area.

549
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,825
-Yes.
-I'm not hungry.

550
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,750
I said I'm not hungry.

551
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,795
That woman over there. Don't we know her?

552
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,592
It's Ms. Descendant.

553
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,303
I think I've seen that guy somewhere.

554
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,346
I'm sure that's Mr. Shin.

555
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,764
Sorry?

556
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,766
He's the CEO of the resort I model for.

557
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,269
I didn't know those two knew each other.

558
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,355
Oh, right. It's that friend of hers
who seemed rich.

559
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:24,899
It's him.

560
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,817
I didn't know he was a CEO.

561
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,361
-I guess he really is rich.
-Let's go.

562
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,585
Maybe...
I shouldn't have said what I said earlier.

563
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,253
I'm sorry for ruining the mood.

564
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,132
No, that's not it. I was just...

565
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,634
I know what you're thinking.

566
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,470
You're viewing me
from a doctor's point of view, aren't you?

567
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,140
"It's weird that he's talking
as if it's not a big deal."

568
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,309
-No, that's not--
-"Does he have DID?

569
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,853
Is he a psychopath?
Could he have anger management problems?"

570
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,980
What are you saying?
I never thought any of that.

571
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,359
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

572
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,069
I'll take the bus.

573
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,530
The night breeze is nice.
I want to walk a little.

574
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,199
Okay.

575
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,826
It's nice weather to take a walk.

576
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,328
Thank you for today.

577
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:22,998
By the way,

578
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,793
I'm curious about something.

579
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,170
I've been curious since yesterday.

580
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,257
Let me ask you, now that
we're talking about the wind.

581
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,845
How fast is the wind
that shook your heart?

582
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,647
-Mura.
-Yes?

583
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,315
Do you want the answer...

584
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,278
to the question you asked me earlier?

585
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,283
Biryeom is wrong.

586
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,617
Really?

587
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,786
The truth isn't important.

588
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,205
What's important is my answer.

589
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,291
You're right.

590
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,795
Your answer is what's important.

591
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,881
-Right?
-Pardon?

592
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,394
<i>How fast is the wind</i>
<i>that shook your heart?</i>

593
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,690
I'd like to know if I'm capable of
stopping that wind.

594
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,572
I don't think that wind means
that much to me.

595
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,366
There's not much meaning
in calculating its speed.

596
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,620
I'll stop it with my own power
if I want it to stop.

597
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,247
I don't need anyone's help.

598
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,249
And...

599
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,085
it has already stopped.

600
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,422
That's my answer...

601
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,633
to your question.

602
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,856
Is he sleeping already?

603
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,859
My gosh!

604
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,200
I noticed that...

605
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,829
all the lights were off,
so I was wondering

606
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,497
if you still hadn't come home yet.

607
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,962
-Today--
-Go inside. You must be tired.

608
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,339
I'm also going to go inside soon.

609
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,217
Okay.

610
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,343
Yun So-a.

611
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,055
Come home early from now on.

612
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,516
It's too late right now.

613
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,477
And it's also too dark.

614
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,020
Okay.

615
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,569
Well, you sometimes...

616
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:24,072
came out and stood by the streetlight

617
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,910
and wondered how you can
get your power back.

618
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,288
So I was wondering if you'd be
doing the same thing--

619
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,831
I'm not doing that anymore.

620
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,335
I'm going to return to
the Land of Water anyway.

621
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,432
<i>Those from our realm</i>
<i>can leave traces here,</i>

622
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,810
<i>but none of us has blood.</i>

623
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,488
-<i>Yes?</i>
-About the lowly deities...

624
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,533
Do you know a lowly deity
that knows everything,

625
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,786
-including stories from a long time ago?
-<i>Stories from a long time ago?</i>

626
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,747
I feel like...

627
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,793
I might know something about this blood.

628
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,926
What's his problem?

629
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,430
He's so cold. Did he watch a movie
that has a cold-blooded character in it?

630
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,810
And why did he have to
call me by my full name?

631
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,396
<i>I'm not going to do that anymore.</i>

632
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,773
<i>I'm going to return to</i>
<i>the Land of Water anyway.</i>

633
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,608
I already know.

634
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,988
He didn't need to tell me again.

635
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,909
Did he find out that I sold the land?

636
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,121
Whatever. It's my land.
I'll do whatever I want with it.

637
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,753
DECLARATION OF INTENT TO SELL

638
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,130
It's all over now.

639
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,301
I'm going to clear everything now.

640
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,512
I can't wait to go to Vanuatu.

641
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,431
<i>You may sell everything else,</i>

642
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,349
<i>but not the land.</i>

643
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,273
You're not talking to me, are you?

644
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,611
What am I thinking right now?

645
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,543
Goodness!

646
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,511
Are you in there?

647
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,555
I need to talk to you.

648
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,689
My gosh! You surprised me.

649
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,776
Why didn't you answer me?

650
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,946
-What do you want?
-I have something to ask you.

651
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,907
-It's for my mental health.
-What is it?

652
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,909
Why can't I sell that land?

653
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,079
The gate will stay there even
when the owner of the land changes.

654
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,122
-That's right.
-Then why can't I sell it?

655
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,708
It's not like it will get blocked.

656
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,460
It might be a bit uncomfortable,

657
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,879
but you guys have powers
to overcome all that.

658
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,967
-That's why I told you to do as you wish.
-I know, but I'd still like to know why.

659
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,930
They'll criticize me for not being able
to protect that land.

660
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,898
But I thought none of that mattered
because you're born to be the king anyway.

661
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,693
Yes, it doesn't matter.

662
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,239
But even in our world,
there are those who seek opportunity.

663
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,908
Does that answer your question?

664
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,910
If it did, please leave.

665
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,708
Rest up.

666
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,929
That's nothing compared to my situation.

667
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,976
And it's not like it'll happen for sure.
It's just an assumption, isn't it?

668
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,811
Asking me to give up my choice

669
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,896
because of that
is not something a god should do.

670
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,274
I'm good now. It's all clear.1

671
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:46,960
They'll criticize me...

672
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,547
for not being able to protect that land.

673
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,520
<i>SIMA QIAN, THE WAYS OF HUMANS</i>

674
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,862
Bacteria is a living thing too. It's sad
that we have to kill them under the sun.

675
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,197
What?

676
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,451
Did you eat?

677
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,161
Do you want to eat together?

678
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,080
We're going to eat with Lady Mura.

679
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,957
Really? That's good to hear.

680
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,669
By the way, we saw you with the CEO
of the resort yesterday.

681
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,673
-What?
-That guy who looks rich.

682
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,550
You guys looked good together.

683
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,555
Let's go.

684
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:42,933
See you later.

685
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,402
He saw me?

686
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,072
Does that mean he knows
I signed the contract?

687
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,659
How can he be sure that he's the one
who is buying my land?

688
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,744
Wait a minute.

689
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,247
He saw the contract.

690
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,040
That means he knows, right?

691
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,917
No.

692
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,670
He already told me that
he doesn't know anything.

693
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,840
Did he find out?

694
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,343
Is that why he met with that goddess?
Did they meet to plan...

695
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,554
Whatever. So what if he knows?

696
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,972
He told me to do as I please.

697
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,432
My gosh! What am I supposed to do?

698
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,858
What's gotten into you?
You never come to my house.

699
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,944
Why didn't you answer your phone?
I kept calling you last night.

700
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,240
Do you know a lowly deity
who has lived as long as the High Priest?

701
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,117
As long as the High Priest?

702
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,412
-Yes, there is one.
-Who?

703
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,081
You know him too.

704
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,057
My gosh.

705
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,814
You're going overboard.

706
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:16,818
Hey, stop putting on an act.
There's no one else but us.

707
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,748
I saw the news a couple of days ago.

708
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,125
-It was you, wasn't it?
-What are you talking about?

709
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,336
An employee at a department store
stopped an old lady from parking

710
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,587
in a handicapped people space.

711
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,256
Then she got furious
and slapped the employee

712
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,967
for not recognizing a VIP customer.

713
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,638
I was just trying to educate
a dumb human being.

714
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,640
I don't know why everyone's
so upset about that.

715
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,351
It's getting harder to live here
these days.

716
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,186
Hey, Eunuch Kim!

717
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,856
-Long time no see.
-Don't call me "Eunuch."

718
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,319
-Can't you see this badge?
-My gosh, what a nice car.

719
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,696
All your life, you learned how to steal.

720
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,200
300 years ago,
you were in and out of prison.

721
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,620
I guess what you learned back then
is finally working to your advantage.

722
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,248
Do you know how much I suffered

723
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,541
because you told on me to a human king
back then?

724
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,252
You mannerless jerk.

725
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,796
We're both lowly.
Let's stop talking about manners.

726
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,632
Do you have any good news?

727
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,093
I'll take anything
regarding politics, society,

728
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,680
economics, and entertainment.
Let's help each other out here.

729
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,431
-I don't know.
-My gosh!

730
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,018
Jingeon. I haven't seen him in so long.

731
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,562
Have you ever heard his voice before?

732
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,856
Can he talk?

733
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,485
Our hero.

734
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,445
Jugeollin the Scaredy-cat is also here.

735
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,035
-Lord Judong has disappeared?
-Yes.

736
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,205
They want us to find him
when they can't even find him themselves.

737
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,042
I was looking forward to not seeing
any of those gods in this world.

738
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,879
<i>I guess that's why Habaek is still here.</i>

739
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,383
Jugeollin, you're our one and only hero.

740
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,342
He's right.

741
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,470
You're the only one
who scarred Habaek's face and ran away.

742
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,641
My gosh, how can you say that
about our future king?

743
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,892
What?

744
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:14,811
Why are you scared?

745
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,063
He may be a king there,
but he's nothing here.

746
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,483
Why do you think we're staying
in this pathetic world of humans?

747
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,236
If I see him right now...

748
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,830
-I don't know.
-My gosh! I'm going!

749
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,673
Okay.

750
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,804
My gosh. I've never seen
a pack of criminals meet for breakfast.

751
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,931
What are you doing at this hour?

752
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,934
You can't even come up with anything
in broad daylight.

753
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,020
I'll go now.

754
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,357
I don't know. Let's go.

755
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,192
I don't know.

756
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,155
You can't go yet. Wait here.

757
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,308
My gosh, why is Mura here?

758
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,019
I don't know.
They're seriously killing me.

759
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,488
Lady Mura, I...

760
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,739
How dare you

761
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,200
scar Habaek's face and run away?

762
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,952
I only ran away

763
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,872
because you were threatening
to kill me back then.

764
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,753
I really didn't say anything
to Lord Habaek.

765
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,381
I didn't tell him anything about
who made me challenge him.

766
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,757
Shut that mouth.

767
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,884
Yes, of course.

768
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,053
I didn't tell him it was you
who told me to challenge--

769
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,223
-I told you to shut it.
-Yes, okay.

770
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,184
You told me to beat Habaek until--

771
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,686
Shut it! Just shut that mouth!

772
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,023
Shut it if you don't want me
to crush your tongue.

773
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,277
If you want me to spare your life
in this world, shut your mouth!

774
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,863
Yes, I will shut my mouth.

775
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,199
Are you guys shooting a comedy show?

776
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,708
What's so funny?

777
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,212
You both are like
you're from <i>Dumb and Dumber.</i>

778
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,047
Rather than Habaek finding out,

779
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,967
you're more scared that he'll find out
that you were jealous.

780
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,220
That challenge incident happened

781
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,931
when the woman named Shim
got sold for 300 packs of rice.

782
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,391
Am I correct?

783
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,602
You were mistaken.

784
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,061
Habaek didn't like her either.

785
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,106
You were just too blind to see that.

786
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,237
Hey,

787
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,406
just tell him how you feel.

788
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,283
It's much better to get rejected
face-to-face.

789
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,743
Why do you care?

790
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,621
I just can't stand to watch you
be like this. That's why.

791
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,039
What?

792
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,209
You're a goddess.
You can't be this pathetic.

793
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,722
Hey, take me with you. What's going on?

794
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,724
Hey.

795
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,896
Does everyone hate me?

796
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,200
-It's expensive. Do you like it?
-Not really.

797
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,702
Eat up. We always need
to prepare ourselves.

798
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,791
What would Jugeollin know
about that stone?

799
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,377
The High Priest once told me something.

800
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,588
I didn't put much meaning into it
back then.

801
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,591
But if he's lived
as long as the High Priest,

802
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,301
he might actually know something.

803
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:19,639
-What did the High Priest say?
-Do you know... the story about that guy?

804
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,190
<i>I brought him here.</i>

805
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,947
My gosh.

806
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,534
Lord Habaek.

807
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,245
Lord Habaek.

808
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,089
Please kill...

809
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,674
No. Please have mercy.

810
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,467
No, just kill...

811
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,595
No. Please have mercy.

812
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,265
I must have lost my mind back then.

813
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,725
Shut that mouth of yours.

814
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,021
Listen to me carefully.
We're going to ask you a few questions.

815
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,814
If you answer them,
we'll set you free.

816
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,108
But if you say anything to anyone,

817
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,193
I'm going to freeze and break

818
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,529
that flapping tongue of yours.

819
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,533
Do you know a lowly deity named Jingeon?
Do you know why he can't talk?

820
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,542
What is this?

821
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,379
I brought this stone from the Divine Gate.
It has the bloodstain of a human being.

822
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,798
Oh, is that so?

823
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,092
What?

824
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,722
That can't be.

825
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,892
-The Divine Gate cannot--
-I know. That's why I'm asking you.

826
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,937
In what circumstance can this be possible?

827
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,485
There's no way that this can happen.

828
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,944
Let me rephrase that.

829
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,113
Who can make this...

830
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,115
possible?

831
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,785
No one can make this possible...

832
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,917
No way!

833
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,837
That can't be.

834
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,589
This is not possible.

835
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,966
What are you saying?
Tell us what you mean.

836
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,387
If this is really
the blood of a human being,

837
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,763
it should've disappeared

838
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,973
because that's what the land
is supposed to do.

839
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,727
But if this blood does not disappear
with the power of that land,

840
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,522
that means it's him.

841
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,108
What are you saying?
Who are you talking about?

842
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,819
That's right. Him.

843
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,321
You also think it's him, right?

844
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,572
What are you guys...

845
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,453
No way.

846
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,123
Can you also tell me
what you're all talking about?

847
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,459
But there's no way that he could be here.

848
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:01,008
I'm just saying that because
nobody has ever seen him before.

849
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,886
I'm just saying that he can't be here.

850
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,477
Biryeom always talks about him too.

851
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,689
You both could spend
the whole night talking about him.

852
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,982
What is this about?

853
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,067
I'm pretty sure Jugeollin is right.

854
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,738
I believed it when the High Priest
told me about it.

855
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,615
But after I gave it some thought,
it made no sense at all.

856
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,742
What are you talking about?

857
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:29,537
But then why did
the High Priest say that to me?

858
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,914
-What did he say?
-What are you talking about?

859
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,416
You guys are having a late meal.

860
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:42,675
He's my friend.

861
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,051
You saw him yesterday.

862
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,387
He's Shin Hu-ye, the owner of this hotel.

863
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:51,058
We saw you by coincidence last night.
You were with a woman we know.

864
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,523
Are you the patient
that was with Ms. Yun last time?

865
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,027
Did you pretend to be a patient?

866
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,531
I guess I jumped to conclusions.
Let me apologize.

867
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,497
He's not very social.
Please be understanding.

868
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,374
No, it's okay. I'm the one
who offended him first.

869
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,294
Then please enjoy your meal.

870
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,301
I would've definitely fallen for him
if I were human.

871
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,387
He's too good for the servant,

872
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,473
but we should wish them both
the best of luck.

873
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,767
Where were we?

874
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,604
Yes, the High Priest.
What did he say to you?

875
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:37,730
Ms. Yun.

876
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,567
Ms. Descendant.

877
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,322
What are you doing here?

878
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,575
Well, the thing is...

879
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,662
I came here to meet someone.

880
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,914
Did you meet someone?

881
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:55,832
What?

882
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,876
No, never mind.

883
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,672
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes?

884
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,882
You're restless,
and you're not making any sense.

885
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,344
If you act like this,
I might mistakenly think that

886
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,971
you changed your mind overnight.

887
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,559
I got rejected, right?

888
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:16,769
Pardon?

889
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,400
I guess she really must be in
a good relationship with that rich guy.

890
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,695
I've never seen him smile like that.

891
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,450
Habaek.

892
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,790
Mr. Shin, follow me.

893
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,794
Excuse me.

894
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,303
I got you.

895
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,977
You just got caught.

896
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,596
<i>-Did you know about him?</i>
<i>-It's impossible.</i>

897
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,390
<i>-This guy's identity.</i>
-<i>His identity?</i>

898
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,558
<i>Yun So-a.</i>

899
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,685
<i>Just like we suspect So-a</i>
<i>because she is with him.</i>

900
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,854
<i>Is that the kind of relationship</i>
<i>you have with the CEO of the resort?</i>

901
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,231
<i>Wouldn't he become curious about her</i>
<i>because she is with you?</i>

902
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:47,276
<i>How about we come home together tomorrow</i>
<i>since we didn't get to do it today?</i>

903
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,861
<i>How does she know who they are?</i>

904
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,196
<i>Reveal who you really are.</i>

905
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,530
<i>He's stronger than Lord Habaek?</i>

906
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:55,034
I guess they did not warn you
about my powers.

907
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,243
That power of yours...

908
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,244
<i>Habaek!</i>

909
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,412
<i>I said stop!</i>
