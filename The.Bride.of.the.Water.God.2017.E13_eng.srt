1
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>Ms. Yun?</i>

2
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>Ms. Yun.</i>

3
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,955
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

4
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,874
I told you not to stay out late.

5
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,378
You never listen to me, do you?

6
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,874
It looks like you've lost some weight.

7
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,459
Your eyes look sunken too.

8
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,336
And what are these under your eyes?

9
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,839
Are they the thing called dark circles?

10
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,633
I like you like this.

11
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,595
I was going to go back right away

12
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,221
if you looked like freesias in spring.

13
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,273
I've warned you.

14
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,817
Once you fall for me,

15
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,778
there's no way out.

16
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,302
Let's go home.

17
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,337
Ms. Descendant.

18
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,719
My gosh, I missed you.

19
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,389
What happened?

20
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,475
He's been given a new mission. We can
come here when we're given a mission.

21
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,393
A mission?

22
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,563
What kind of mission?

23
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,357
He has to find some kind of meaning,
which sounds so tough.

24
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,067
He has to have a revelation of some sort.

25
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,652
There's such a mission?

26
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,074
He's ridiculously stubborn.

27
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,704
<i>When we got to the Land of Water,</i>
<i>the red tide had come four times.</i>

28
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,417
<i>Lord Habaek was having trouble</i>
<i>adjusting to the new environment.</i>

29
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,130
-What? "The new environment"?
-Yes.

30
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,674
Things in the Land of Water
are very different from here.

31
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,926
I see.

32
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,596
Usually, you become
just a little bit more sensitive.

33
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,891
But Lord Habaek was awfully quiet,
as if he was angry,

34
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,351
and he seemed listless.

35
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,354
Then one day,
he started pestering everyone.

36
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,692
Lord Habaek.

37
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,949
The High Priest is visiting
the Land of the Sky at the moment,

38
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,701
-but he left a message for you.
-Which is?

39
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,287
He said finding out why
the sacred stones are kept

40
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,540
in the human world was not your mission.

41
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,211
Must that old man
keep being this stubborn?

42
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,297
Back then,
he made it sound very meaningful.

43
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,426
As far as he remembers, you told him
that you couldn't be bothered.

44
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,303
Right, I did. However,

45
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,349
he told me again that
I must find the answer to the question.

46
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,184
"It wasn't a question."

47
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,937
From what he remembers,
that was your answer.

48
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,648
It was a question.

49
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,403
Also,
Lord Habaek will be our next emperor.

50
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,572
Why can't the High Priest just give in?

51
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,866
Keep it up.

52
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,372
Lord Habaek would like to find the answer.

53
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,503
I mean, have you ever seen him
volunteering to do anything?

54
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,716
That's what happened.

55
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,802
Because he was so persistent,

56
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,930
the High Priest finally managed
to get permission to send him back here.

57
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,599
I wonder what he's trying to find, though.

58
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,020
I see that Yongyong is here.

59
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,777
Well, it's...

60
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,531
I didn't know you'd use a plush toy
to satisfy your emotional needs.

61
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,367
That's not why it's here. It's...

62
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,621
Did you pick on Yongyong?

63
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,999
Did you abuse him?

64
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,002
Or every night,
when you were feeling lonely...

65
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,589
I hope you didn't do
anything weird to him.

66
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,427
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

67
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,989
It's so much faster this way.
Why did you always take a detour?

68
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,126
Nothing has changed.

69
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,546
I told you to clean the place often.

70
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,134
It's harder to try to clean it
after a long time.

71
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,637
I told you to get a different light
for your entrance.

72
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,431
I also told you to eat well.

73
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,434
You haven't even canceled
the phone contract.

74
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,021
You never do what I tell you to do.

75
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,198
Anyway, how have you been?

76
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,913
What are you trying to find here?

77
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,122
What do you mean?

78
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,166
Namsuri said...

79
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,044
you've been given a new mission.

80
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,465
I heard you have to find out
why the sacred stones are kept here.

81
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,348
I don't care about that.

82
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,227
I came back because
I knew you weren't doing well.

83
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,692
I...

84
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,987
have to go back.

85
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,908
That's still the path I must take.

86
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,251
I came to say goodbye properly.

87
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:48,921
Properly.

88
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,384
I want to love you with no regrets.

89
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,222
Even if we have to part ways,

90
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,976
I want to be able to convince myself
that I loved you enough.

91
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,484
If you're not ready...

92
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,281
If you don't agree with me...

93
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,744
I'll just go back.

94
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,966
So you want to love properly...

95
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,262
so that you can say a proper goodbye.

96
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,728
It doesn't make much sense,

97
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,106
but it still sounds very nice.

98
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,281
Looking back...

99
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,079
I'm realizing that I've been
too ungenerous to myself.

100
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,793
Who would have wanted to love me...

101
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,171
when I didn't love myself?

102
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,094
Someone must have felt sorry for me.

103
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,974
That's why I got lucky like this.

104
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,109
It's because you're a nice person.

105
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,112
I'm not nice.

106
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,613
You are.

107
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,075
Fine.

108
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,037
It's not easy to be nice
when you live in a world like this.

109
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:51,252
"All that a nice person ever gets
is a decent guy." Is that the lesson?

110
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,130
A story like that wouldn't even sell
these days.

111
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,965
Am I just a decent guy?

112
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,217
I'm a god.

113
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,052
Then...

114
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,931
"A nice person gets to meet a god."
Is that the lesson?

115
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,433
Do you think that's enough?

116
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,559
Then...

117
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,603
what else?

118
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,273
Something like this.

119
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,706
HABAEK
YUN SO-A

120
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,250
Just help her forget Habaek.

121
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,918
That's not something I can easily do.

122
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,086
Give it a try.

123
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,421
You were planning on doing that anyway.

124
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,757
That is not...

125
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,597
something I can easily do.

126
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,506
Ms. Descendant.

127
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,100
Why are you coming out of that room?

128
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,226
What?

129
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,104
Well, I...

130
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,898
I was just looking for something.

131
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,024
What were you looking for?

132
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,526
Never mind.

133
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,697
-What were you looking for?
-Oh, nothing. Don't mind me.

134
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,741
Were you looking for me?

135
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,423
I'm going to work part-time
starting today.

136
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,301
I called the owner of
the duck boat tour company earlier,

137
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,844
and he wants to meet right away.

138
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,431
He was so sad when I told him
that you couldn't work there anymore.

139
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,767
Don't you have to go to work?

140
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,146
No. My clinic will be closed
for a little while.

141
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,190
What? Why?

142
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,484
Some stuff happened.

143
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,444
It's a good thing, though.

144
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,365
I live with an omnipotent god.
Why should I work so hard to earn money?

145
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,283
Let me benefit
from your amazing powers now.

146
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,620
-He doesn't have any.
-Sorry?

147
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,126
-He doesn't have any powers.
-What?

148
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,338
You still haven't gotten them back?

149
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,550
You said they'd come back
when you returned to the divine realm.

150
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,343
-They did.
-And?

151
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,012
-He left them there.
-What?

152
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,806
Leave what?

153
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,142
-I can't take my powers with me?
-Correct.

154
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,352
He said you'll have to leave
exactly how you came back

155
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,479
if you wish to return
to the human world that much.

156
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,190
But why? Why does he have to do that?

157
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,151
He said that's only fair.

158
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,068
"Fair"?

159
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,405
Fair for whom?

160
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,157
He said there will be
no more negotiations,

161
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,283
-but...
-What?

162
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,160
You won't accomplish the mission anyway,

163
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,745
so he'll put a precautionary measure
in place

164
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,414
because you have to come back
for the coronation ceremony.

165
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,540
"A precautionary measure"?

166
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,418
He said that he'll allow you
to use your abilities just once

167
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,420
so that you can open
the Divine Gate and return.

168
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,839
When the sixth red tide comes,

169
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,257
he'll send a messenger to you.

170
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,134
-What?
-"Don't go if you don't like the terms."

171
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,386
He also said that.

172
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,930
<i>That's what happened.</i>

173
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,436
Are they a lunch bag or what?
How can you just leave them there?

174
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,399
By the way, why did you lose
your powers in the first place?

175
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,026
I've asked him a few times,

176
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,153
but he just kept giving me creepy smirks.

177
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,864
He just said it can happen.
He was so vague about it.

178
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,199
Then...

179
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,951
are you saying you came back empty-handed?

180
00:17:59,036 --> 00:17:59,870
No, with hunger.

181
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,124
Don't worry. Those in the Land of Water
aren't that heartless.

182
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,334
I was told that I could take

183
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,045
one thing that's most needed
in the human world except for my powers,

184
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,923
-so I brought it.
-Really? What is it?

185
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,384
Something like a magic wand?
Can it make gold and silver?

186
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,469
It's much more...

187
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,304
powerful than that.

188
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,057
Namsuri.

189
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,065
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD, NAMSURI
DRIVER'S LICENSE, HABAEK

190
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,169
What is that?

191
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,505
No way.

192
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,175
-A driver's license?
-Mine is a resident registration card.

193
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,011
Now, I'll do all the driving.

194
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,430
Now, I'm legally allowed to work.

195
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,336
-What is it?
-Answer the call.

196
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,800
Stop bothering Mr. Kim so much.
Don't you feel bad for him?

197
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,804
He's the protagonist of his own life.

198
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,391
And if his life were a movie,

199
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,228
you'd only be a supporting character.
A mean one.

200
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,649
Don't say that he earns a living
thanks to you.

201
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,151
Thanks to your staff,

202
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,028
you can lounge around like this.

203
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,157
You guys are all doing
what each other can't do.

204
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,492
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

205
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,287
I guess it's because of what I saw.

206
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,416
I saw humans talking about
things like that on TV yesterday.

207
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,210
Answer it.

208
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,174
What do you want?

209
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,055
What is it, Mr. Kim?

210
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,183
<i>Please tell Biryeom</i>
<i>that I'm so grateful for his help.</i>

211
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,977
Thank you very much, Biryeom.

212
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,607
The director said that you can shoot
the kissing scene again

213
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,525
when you're ready. He said he can wait.

214
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,236
<i>Tell Biryeom...</i>

215
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,279
<i>Let him know that--</i>

216
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,448
Hello?

217
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,243
I'm not done. How can she hang up on me?

218
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,829
Let's have lunch.<i> </i>I made a reservation
at the new restaurant.

219
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,832
Life is all about enjoying
good food and drink.

220
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,168
It sounds like you might end up
staying here for good.

221
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,962
The humans I saw on TV yesterday said

222
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,756
that no one exists for someone else.
But they're wrong

223
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,968
because I can confidently say
that I exist for you.

224
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,638
Is that so? Is that why you sold the land
and traveled the world for ten years?

225
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,516
I came back from time to time
and entertained you.

226
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,477
Oh, did you hate that I was away
for a long time?

227
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,982
No. Of course not.

228
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,529
Things are so peaceful between us
now that Habaek is gone.

229
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,239
I should've sent him back a long time ago.

230
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,830
You look gorgeous enough now,
so just get changed. Do nothing else.

231
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,633
Goodbye,

232
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,510
my love.

233
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,263
Don't come back again.

234
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,933
Don't ask the forest for directions.

235
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,937
Don't send your regards through the wind.

236
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,608
I'll just remember...

237
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,611
that you were my everything.

238
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,370
Why didn't you knock?

239
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,123
It looks like you'll be traumatized by it.

240
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,584
-What are you going to do?
-Trauma, my foot.

241
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,669
I'm the greatest goddess
of the Land of Water, Mura.

242
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,632
I can't watch you go through this.

243
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,425
Let me help you.

244
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,755
All right. That's how it feels.

245
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,715
Remember that feeling.

246
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,052
-Then you'll get out of your slump.
-Hey!

247
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,181
Why are you being like this?

248
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,310
It looks like you keep forgetting
the fact that I'm your fiancé.

249
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,700
You'd better not say that word,
"fiancé," ever again.

250
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,915
What are you talking about?

251
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,168
You begged me to be your fiancé.

252
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,044
Have you changed your mind?

253
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,838
When did I beg you?

254
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,174
You wanted me to tell Habaek
that we're engaged.

255
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,218
You were jealous of that girl, Shim Chong.

256
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,762
When I told Habaek,

257
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,973
he congratulated us. Don't you remember?

258
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,768
Back then, I even broke up with a girl

259
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,479
to accommodate that request of yours.

260
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,814
She was the prettiest girl
in the Land of the Sky.

261
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,234
That was...

262
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,612
You weren't that into her anyway.

263
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,740
And everyone knows that you're a player.

264
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,325
Come on.

265
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,620
This "player" has a heart too.

266
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,877
Let go. I said, let go!

267
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,838
Without Habaek, it's so peaceful here.

268
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,386
Why do you keep acting like
you don't know how I feel about you?

269
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,098
Gosh.

270
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,269
It's not easy to put on an act
for so long,

271
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,980
and it's certainly not easy
to play along for this long.

272
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,358
But somehow, this setup has been working.

273
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,158
Let's get something to eat.

274
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,498
Don't hit me, please.

275
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,874
It hurts.

276
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,335
Don't talk to me.

277
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,932
Goodness.

278
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,526
Did I do it again?

279
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,863
Yes, you did.
You're in worse shape than last time.

280
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,490
I'm sorry...

281
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,242
for being such a bother.

282
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,661
Is it because of the girl?

283
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,043
I don't know why I keep reaching out
to you for help when I have my secretary.

284
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,628
This won't happen again.

285
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:36,136
When the King ordered me
to take you away from your mother,

286
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,096
I really didn't want to do it.

287
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,938
The same goes for when he ordered me
to imprison you in that cave.

288
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,527
But there wasn't much I could do
as a powerless lowly deity.

289
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,114
<i>I tried to just ignore you,</i>
<i>but it wasn't easy.</i>

290
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:00,535
<i>As a human baby,</i>
<i>you were so little and weak.</i>

291
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,330
<i>I hoped you'd just die on your own.</i>

292
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,748
<i>But eventually,</i>

293
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,083
<i>I realized that you're</i>
<i>half mortal and half immortal,</i>

294
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,210
<i>which means you'd always be alone.</i>

295
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,673
<i>You'd always be lonely,</i>
<i>imprisoned in that cave forever.</i>

296
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,092
<i>I felt sorry for you and scared.</i>

297
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,219
<i>Part of me wanted to abandon you,</i>

298
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,555
<i>and another part of me wanted to save you.</i>

299
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:25,268
<i>I tried so hard</i>
<i>not to become attached to you.</i>

300
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,355
Whenever I visited you at the cave,

301
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:32,275
I told you about the world of gods,
but it wasn't for your sake.

302
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,526
I did it for my own sake.

303
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,322
And I came here to avoid you.

304
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:38,948
But...

305
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,076
it didn't work out.

306
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,330
The whole cave was already inside me,

307
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,707
and you were still cowering in it.

308
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,711
I'd like to...

309
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,006
show you a hidden part of me.

310
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,012
In the human world,

311
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,099
even beggars have to care about
their looks. That's why I wear it,

312
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,809
but it's so uncomfortable.

313
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,395
You look much better without it.

314
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,854
Do you want a piece of advice?

315
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,818
Show her who you are.

316
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,196
Let her know who you really are.

317
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,575
Like this. That's how everything begins.

318
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,206
If it doesn't work out
even after you show her everything,

319
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,374
that means...

320
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,044
you two aren't meant to be together.

321
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,472
Hey, wait.

322
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,725
Why is a car so important?

323
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,519
How could you do this to me?
I jumped through hoops...

324
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,396
to bring this here.

325
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,399
Why bother bringing it?

326
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,401
You should've brought
a magic wand instead.

327
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,862
I wanted to drive. Legally, like you said.

328
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,782
Let's just run instead.

329
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,660
Let's run along the Han River
starting tomorrow.

330
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,788
Unbelievable.

331
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,500
A man can't love without a car.

332
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,796
What did you say?

333
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,174
What kind of nonsense is that?

334
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,800
Hey!

335
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,595
Where does that distorted view come from?

336
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,395
-What happened?
-I've been given a new mission.

337
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,856
Don't be ridiculous.

338
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,401
It might come in handy for you as well.
You can use it when you need it.

339
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,329
I can't believe you.

340
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,255
Did you really have to do this?

341
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,510
How could you do this to Mura?

342
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,386
I know what she's worried about.

343
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,304
Then...

344
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:13,394
-can't you at least act like you listen?
-There are things I must decide on my own.

345
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,979
Don't tell me you're not going back.

346
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,149
You know full well what will happen
if you don't go back.

347
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,318
I will go back.

348
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,738
Why is Mura...

349
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,784
-not enough for you?
-Don't insult her.

350
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,371
I know that you don't even mean it.

351
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,708
Why don't you muster up more courage
instead of testing me like this?

352
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,753
I wish hatred were allowed
in the divine realm as well.

353
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,172
Then you'd be my sworn enemy.

354
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,674
I'll think about it
when I ascend the throne.

355
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,925
I'll look forward to it.

356
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,886
I hope we'll meet again as enemies.

357
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,487
Are you okay?

358
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,615
You're actually not smart at all.

359
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,620
I'm not on your side.

360
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,372
And I'm obviously not on Habaek's side.

361
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,208
I'll do what Mura wants.

362
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,295
I'm the one...

363
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,380
who did that to your family.

364
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,009
Mura was seething
because of your ancestor,

365
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,554
-so I took a little revenge.
-What?

366
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,515
Just hope that Mura is not as angry
as she was back then.

367
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,311
Things are much simpler here
than in the world of gods.

368
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,037
Why did you talk to that good-for-nothing
for so long?

369
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,330
Did you order?

370
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,083
I asked them for this black water.

371
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,376
And they understood?

372
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,379
They seemed to understand.

373
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,881
Is this what you came here for?

374
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,175
I can't say this wasn't the reason at all.

375
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,220
-So? Can you get your car back?
-It's gone.

376
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,640
That's great.

377
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,099
I asked for a new car.

378
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,976
I told them I wanted
to drive the car today.

379
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,895
What?

380
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,688
And? What did they say?

381
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,859
-They said it's not possible.
-Of course it's not.

382
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,446
I'm shocked.

383
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,991
I can't believe you can't buy a car
as easily as you buy clothes.

384
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,619
Have you become a complete idiot or what?

385
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,330
I asked him to make me one
using his powers.

386
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,000
That's ridiculous. Are you a kid?

387
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,377
Anyway, what did he say to that?

388
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,294
He refused.

389
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,923
But he said he'll go to a car dealership
where he's a VIP client--

390
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,760
What's going on?

391
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,263
<i>She is Habaek's woman.</i>

392
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,057
I was...

393
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,394
one step too late.

394
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,356
He's the King.

395
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,108
I can...

396
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,611
never change that.

397
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,614
I can't help...

398
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,993
but feel insecure.

399
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,664
When I found out that he left,

400
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,124
I secretly...

401
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,711
started feeling confident.

402
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,841
His limitations...

403
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,345
are very different from mine,
which is a huge relief.

404
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,889
But...

405
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,686
he's back.

406
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,938
Jugeollin?

407
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,975
-What are you trying to do?
-I'm trying...

408
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,145
to lift the curse I put on you.

409
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,773
Then you should've told me.
Why suddenly run at me like that?

410
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,357
I apologize.

411
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,786
Come on.
Lift the curse and be on your way.

412
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,370
Does that mean...

413
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,998
you haven't got your powers back yet?

414
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,423
All right, then. Here it comes.

415
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,828
No!

416
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,542
She's right. This is crazy. I can't do it.

417
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,796
I'm used to hunger. Living like this
isn't too bad, so just leave me alone.

418
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,256
-Sorry?
-And mark my words.

419
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,008
Further down the road,

420
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,010
I'll be sure to teach you
a serious lesson.

421
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,563
Hey.

422
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,653
-We got a car.
-What?

423
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,322
What does it mean to have
the eyes of the cat in <i>Shrek?</i>

424
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,535
He said he smiled at the woman
who came to pick up the car with such eyes

425
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,078
and persuaded her to give up the car.

426
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,738
Jingeon.

427
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,823
Find out where Mura is now.

428
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,285
He lost... his powers?

429
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,078
That's right.

430
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,165
He's been without his powers
ever since he came here.

431
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,627
I didn't think you needed to know.
That's why I've kept my mouth shut.

432
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,005
How is it possible for a god
to lose his powers?

433
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,340
That's what I'm saying.

434
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,966
This is what I think, though.

435
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,967
It might be an ordeal

436
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,511
that he must go through
to ascend the throne.

437
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,681
New kings must go through tests when
they're here to find the sacred stones,

438
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,184
but we have no way of knowing
what they actually experience.

439
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,940
So? What is it that you want to say?

440
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,735
This is the human world,
not the divine realm.

441
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,111
Think about it carefully.

442
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,864
Between you and a god
who has lost all his abilities,

443
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,282
who do you think has more?

444
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,201
And who do you think can be stronger?

445
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,040
Darn it!

446
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,381
Jugeollin?

447
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,973
Lady Mura, it's nice to see you here.

448
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,182
What brings you here?

449
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,726
Well, I should get going.

450
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,104
Bye.

451
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,985
Do the two of you know each other?

452
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,530
What brings you here?

453
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,123
Gosh, why is Lady Mura here?

454
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,459
Is that Lord Biryeom?

455
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,717
-Habaek is back.
-I am aware.

456
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,719
You are?

457
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,345
How do you know?

458
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,227
It looks like
you caught those two in the act.

459
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,857
What were they like?

460
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,483
Were they all over each other?

461
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,235
Forget it.

462
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,571
That's not important now.

463
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,991
Listen up.

464
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,453
The war begins now, and I'm on your side.

465
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,707
-You're on my side?
-That's correct. Your ally.

466
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,918
The greatest goddess of
the Land of Water has got your back.

467
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,004
If you can't win her heart,

468
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,756
just take it by force.

469
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,009
Do whatever it takes to quarantine her.
From Habaek, that is.

470
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,931
"By force"?

471
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,643
That's one dangerous remark.

472
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,686
And...

473
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,315
is she suffering
from a contagious disease or what?

474
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,775
Why "quarantine" her?

475
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,694
Habaek is not an easy target, of course.

476
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,654
I'll help you, though.

477
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,490
I heard he lost all his powers.

478
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,617
Your future king.

479
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,869
What...

480
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,787
What?

481
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,332
-What are you saying--
-Without his powers, he's nothing special.

482
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,543
That means I must be
stronger than him here.

483
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,422
-What did you just say?
-I don't need your help.

484
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,132
Please remain neutral.

485
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,636
If you guys use your powers to help him,

486
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,763
I'll have no choice
but to use mine as well.

487
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,889
But...

488
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,059
let's not do that to each other.

489
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,813
Having to use my powers
in the human world...

490
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,900
is one of the things
that I absolutely despise.

491
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,499
What are you doing here?

492
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,459
Let's go.

493
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,846
How dare you touch her
with that filthy hand?

494
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:32,972
Hey!

495
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,893
I've learned to tame my temper
as she nagged me so much about it.

496
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,062
So you'd better lie low
and hide like a rat.

497
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,940
I won't bother you
if you keep out of sight.

498
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,833
What the hell!

499
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,418
Come here.

500
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,879
Let go!

501
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,634
Mr. Shin and I were just talking.

502
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,554
He held my hand
because I was about to fall.

503
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,348
What is the matter with you?

504
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,933
Don't talk to him.

505
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,061
-He's not one of us.
-It's true that he's different.

506
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:22,980
Like you said,

507
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,690
he's a halfie.

508
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,942
I understand why you hate him
and look down on him.

509
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,237
But can't you just think of him
as one of those lowly humans?

510
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
Are you doing this out of fear?

511
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,742
The God of Death?

512
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,911
There's no such thing.

513
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,371
The stories we heard as kids
are just folklore.

514
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,626
Fine.

515
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,628
I get your fear

516
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,380
because you're still so immature.
But the thing is...

517
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,634
I honestly can't understand your rage.

518
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,928
There must be another reason.

519
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,305
Until you tell me everything honestly,

520
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,640
I won't be able to...

521
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,476
accept these behaviors of yours.

522
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,145
What is it?

523
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,315
What's the reason?

524
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,902
Tell me the real reason!

525
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,905
Can't you see that I can't tell you
because it's you?

526
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,908
Because you're the one asking me
for an explanation...

527
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,911
I can't tell you because it's you.

528
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,081
What? Come again?

529
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,667
Why? What does that mean?

530
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,380
Must you get that prick involved in this?

531
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,549
Do you have to resolve the thing
with Habaek like this?

532
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,387
Then I'll seduce that girl, So-a, for you.

533
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,389
Shall I do that?

534
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,766
I can definitely distract her.

535
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,894
It's my specialty, you know.

536
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,525
You're really helpless.

537
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,944
You had to make me slap you, didn't you?

538
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,222
Jingeon.

539
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,391
Jingeon!

540
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,570
Tell me why Biryeom is acting that way.

541
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,572
Tell me what you know.

542
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,367
If you don't, I'm really going
to freeze and crush your tongue.

543
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,039
Tell me why he's going bonkers!

544
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,081
It's because of me.

545
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,835
-What?
-That is all I can tell you.

546
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,463
As for my tongue, do as you wish.

547
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,970
<i>Please slow down.</i>

548
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,973
I read on the internet that you need
to break in a new car

549
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,808
by driving it on a highway.

550
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,185
-Shall we go right now?
-No.

551
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,020
Please slow down.

552
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,522
I have a driver's license,
so I can violate the speed limit now.

553
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,899
What?

554
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,069
Your driver's license doesn't give you
the right to do that.

555
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,071
Really? Then what is it for?

556
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,073
It only gives you the right to drive.

557
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,949
I knew that already. I was just joking.

558
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:21,950
Gosh.

559
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,245
Why would you make such a foolish joke?

560
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,333
Why were you so obsessed
with getting a license?

561
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,629
You said you'd only feel safe
if I had a driver's license.

562
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,466
I personally didn't care about having one,
but I didn't want to make you feel uneasy.

563
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,393
HABAEK
YUN SO-A

564
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,071
Are you upset?

565
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,414
We can do it another day.

566
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,000
You're a little too excited today.

567
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,252
And as for me...

568
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,672
I...

569
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,592
I'd like to calmly look at you like this.

570
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,390
Is this real? Or am I dreaming?

571
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,268
Is this really happening?

572
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,478
Or is it just a dream?

573
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,565
Is this real?

574
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,484
Or am I dreaming?

575
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,195
If this is a dream,

576
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,197
I hope I never wake up.

577
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,372
It's real.

578
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,758
You're right.

579
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,409
-This isn't fun.
-Right, it isn't.

580
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,716
We shouldn't do things that are not fun.

581
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:44,843
Good idea.

582
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,931
Where are you planning to go
for a drive tomorrow?

583
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,974
Should we go see the sunset?

584
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,227
"The sunset"?

585
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:58,106
The sunrise and sunset.
People purposely go to places to watch it.

586
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,275
I always used to say it's pointless.

587
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,195
What's the big deal
about seeing a sunrise or sunset?

588
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,156
Why would you climb a mountain
when you need to come down again?

589
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,326
There's nothing special about the sea.
It's just a large body of water.

590
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:15,457
That's what I said to my students
when I was a private tutor.

591
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,795
I also said that to the editor-in-chief
when I worked as a part-time translator.

592
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,297
I said the same thing
to a restaurant manager,

593
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,216
a department store manager,

594
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,635
and the owner of a convenience store
where I worked.

595
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,138
Who else did I say that to?

596
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,685
Anyway, that's what I used to say
to everyone all my life.

597
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,979
And my conclusion was moving to Vanuatu.

598
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,522
But that's not going to happen.

599
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,858
Tell me every place you want to visit.

600
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,570
Tell me where you want to go
and what you want to do.

601
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,613
Why? Will you make it happen?

602
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,366
-Of course.
-Oh, my.

603
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,077
You know what, though?

604
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,580
You need money to do all those things.

605
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,502
We're both jobless.
How can we afford to do anything?

606
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,257
Gosh, that's why you should've brought
a magic wand.

607
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,485
<i>Don't call me!</i>

608
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,822
I need money.

609
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,532
A lot of money.

610
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,640
Oh, I guess that man was you.

611
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,516
Is So-a not here with you?

612
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,854
What? No, she isn't.

613
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,814
But why are you always with her?

614
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,025
Pardon? When was I with her?

615
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,028
Why did you two come here together
soaked in rain the other day?

616
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,237
What is the meaning of it?

617
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,658
At first, I thought the owner of
those sneakers would be Water...

618
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,243
I mean, I thought they were Habaek's.
But I guess they were yours.

619
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,457
Those are not the sneakers
I saw last time.

620
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,084
Well...

621
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,502
I'm not following at all.

622
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,630
Isn't this a dream?

623
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:27,881
No, I don't think so.

624
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,468
Who are you?

625
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,138
You're definitely Namsuri.

626
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:37,933
What are you doing here?

627
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,310
I thought you left.

628
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,270
-I came back.
-What?

629
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,647
You came back?

630
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,859
So, it's true.

631
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,279
Well, what happened?

632
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,745
-Go that way.
-Pardon?

633
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,747
Yes, My Lord.

634
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:07,921
What happened?

635
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,757
He came back...

636
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,801
because he missed me.

637
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,766
Why did you bring
that weird lady with you?

638
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,103
Last time, she said she was looking
for a part-time helper.

639
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,439
So I asked about it
with my resident registration card.

640
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,690
-"A part-time helper"?
-Yes.

641
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,151
She said all I have to do
is sit in her office all day.

642
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,528
She said she gets inspired by me.

643
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,282
-What?
-She said I inspire her.

644
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,743
She said her psychic abilities
keep coming and going.

645
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,291
She's exactly like you.

646
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,590
She said she feels something from me.

647
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,176
Back then, I avoided her
because I was scared.

648
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,094
But I thought I should give it a try.

649
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,180
But why?

650
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,771
All right, fine. Do your best.

651
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,815
I think we'll need a lot of money.

652
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,532
He came back to say goodbye?

653
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,288
So-a!

654
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,082
Stop it.

655
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,252
Yeom-mi.

656
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,797
Why does everything have to be
so difficult for you?

657
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,007
Yeom-mi.

658
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,926
You see,

659
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,345
I feel so guilty every time I see you.

660
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,932
I'm the youngest daughter
of a rich family.

661
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,392
My family will be fine
for three more generations

662
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,269
even if I do whatever I want to do.

663
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,897
Even if I do as I please,

664
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,233
my life is still very beautiful
and enjoyable.

665
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,945
Because of that,
I sometimes feel guilty when I see you.

666
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,905
It doesn't happen that often, though.

667
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,743
That's why I truly want you
to become happy.

668
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,832
That way,
I won't have to feel guilty anymore.

669
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,626
Yeom-mi.

670
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,545
So-a!

671
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,450
They're weird.

672
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,207
Hey.

673
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,209
Where did you go?

674
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,669
<i>Did your friend leave?</i>

675
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,587
Yes.

676
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,880
I'm on my way to see Mura.

677
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,092
Okay.

678
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,053
I'll see you later, then.

679
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,806
But why do you need to see her?

680
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,600
-<i>I have something to say to her.</i>
-I see.

681
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,059
All right.

682
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,728
Wait, what do you need to say to her?

683
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,770
You don't need to know.

684
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,857
Okay. Bye, then.

685
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:17,903
<i>Wait.</i>

686
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,654
Is it something important?

687
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,992
-Hello?
-What is this about?

688
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,537
-Are you jealous?
-What?

689
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,498
-No, of course not.
-It sounds like you're jealous.

690
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,958
<i>No, not at all.</i>

691
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,586
I'll never be jealous of
your goddess friend.

692
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,588
Gosh, I'm a very rational person.

693
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,505
<i>Really?</i>

694
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,176
I'm the type of god
who gets jealous of your male friends,

695
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,469
so bear that in mind.

696
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,304
<i>I'm not rational.</i>

697
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,016
Come to think of it,

698
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:53,271
I think I can get jealous, too,
from time to time.

699
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,857
Can I hang up now?

700
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,401
<i>I have my part-time job today,</i>
<i>so I'm heading out now. See you later.</i>

701
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,444
A part-time job?

702
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,738
I'm on my way to see a male human friend.

703
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,367
What? What are you talking about?

704
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,244
Why can't I hear you properly?

705
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,079
What? "Jealous"?

706
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,167
-Hi.
-<i>Dr. Yun!</i>

707
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,419
What? What's wrong?

708
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,422
Hey.

709
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,134
Hey, what happened?
The building has been sold?

710
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,220
The owner of the building
suddenly sold it.

711
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,806
And the new owner said
that we can just stay here.

712
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,100
He thinks having a clinic in the building
will increase its value.

713
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,476
Really?

714
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,188
He even lowered our deposit and rent,
saying that it's outrageously high.

715
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,691
He also promised
that he'll never kick us out.

716
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,067
Are you serious?

717
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,111
How can he be so kind?

718
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,821
Shouldn't we go and say hello?

719
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,240
He said he'll come by
and meet all the tenants soon.

720
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,826
You should just take it easy this week.

721
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,036
-Let's reopen next week.
-Okay, sounds good.

722
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,831
Let's think of it as a fresh start
and do our best.

723
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,166
-Let's be passionate!
-Okay.

724
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,085
Let's do a good job.

725
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,230
<i>Tell me why Biryeom is acting that way.</i>

726
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,108
Tell me why he's going bonkers!

727
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,192
It's because of me.

728
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,946
-What?
-That is all I can tell you.

729
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,366
What could it be?

730
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,332
<i>Your body double just finished shooting.</i>

731
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,791
<i>You have one night scene left,</i>

732
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,669
<i>but I think you need to come now</i>
<i>because we need to get you prepared.</i>

733
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,628
Okay.

734
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,798
And you got some gifts from your fans.
I'll put them in your car when you arrive.

735
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,799
<i>Gifts?</i>

736
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,634
I told you not to accept anything.

737
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,137
They kept insisting, so I couldn't say no.

738
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,389
Okay.

739
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,478
She's so weird. What kind of celebrity
bans her fans from giving gifts?

740
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,396
Don't say that.
I like that attitude of hers.

741
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,814
What if she just throws them out?

742
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,196
Where are you?

743
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,447
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

744
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,116
Where were you last night?

745
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,242
<i>Just get to the point.</i>

746
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,787
I need to talk to you.

747
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,747
I have to go to a shoot,
so come to Beriwon...

748
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:18,541
-No. Let's meet--
-<i>Let's meet at Beriwon Resort.</i>

749
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,919
-No, let's just meet--
-<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

750
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,070
-Are you done?
-Yes.

751
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,823
But I didn't see Mr. Min all day.

752
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,742
-He's away on a business trip.
-I see.

753
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,911
The feedback from the employees
has been great.

754
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,038
They say it helps them
better cope with their stress.

755
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,289
Thank you.

756
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,917
You shouldn't be thanking me.

757
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,128
I'm just doing it to pay off my debt.

758
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,256
-You seem happy today.
-A miracle happened.

759
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,467
My clinic can stay in the building.

760
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,970
We have a new landlord now,

761
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,472
and our new landlord
even lowered our deposit and rent.

762
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,849
Really?

763
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,061
-Not many people are like that these days.
-I know.

764
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,356
I should buy a big watermelon for him
and go thank him in person.

765
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,570
You probably can't have dinner with me
this evening, right?

766
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,323
-No, I have--
-Right, I'm sure you have plans.

767
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,242
-I'm not lying.
-I know.

768
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,702
I never said you were.

769
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,829
I'm getting this feeling

770
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,583
that you probably won't be available
for dinner

771
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,002
for quite some time.

772
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,963
I'll wait.

773
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,507
You have a knack
for enduring things, right?

774
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,384
I'm good at waiting.

775
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,472
Let's go. I'll walk you out.

776
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,028
The new owner of that building
must be a cool guy.

777
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,238
A gentleman with a warm heart.

778
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,781
Someone who's got class.

779
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,742
And I'm pretty sure
he's quite good-looking.

780
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,162
I understand and agree
with everything else,

781
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,207
but what is your reason
for assuming that he's good-looking?

782
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,917
Aren't you being biased?

783
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,045
There's no reason, and I'm not biased.
It's just a prediction.

784
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,796
-I'm psychic.
-What?

785
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,550
-Gosh, that'd drive me nuts.
-Sorry?

786
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,263
Stand still. I'm starting to feel antsy
because of you.

787
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,231
-Thank you.
-I feel much better now.

788
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,322
What are you doing here?

789
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:58,868
He's my friend.

790
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,580
What's up?

791
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,083
You're one busy lady, So-a.

792
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,626
What?

793
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,881
I'm not here to talk about Habaek.

794
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,675
I'm just annoyed...

795
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:18,179
to see our servant hanging out
with a prick like you.

796
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,807
What are you doing right now?

797
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,934
There's one more thing that annoys me.

798
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,645
It's the thought of you
hanging out with him,

799
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,063
despite knowing who he really is.

800
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,526
Is he your insurance?
Do you plan to replace Habaek with him?

801
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:33,861
What...

802
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,780
-What are you saying--
-Get away from him!

803
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:36,948
I can't stand this.

804
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,744
What are you doing?

805
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,597
Let's stop playing petty tricks.

806
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,891
-How about we have a real showdown?
-What's your reason for doing this?

807
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:05,977
My reason?

808
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,563
Your very existence is my reason.

809
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,772
I asked you for a reason.

810
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,318
You won't get what you want
until you convince me with a good reason.

811
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,236
Common sense, justice,

812
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,989
and wanting to get rid of abnormal things.
Let's just put it that way.

813
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,033
I don't like the fact

814
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,244
that an abnormal being like you
exists in this world.

815
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,164
I'm just going to tolerate
that kind of criticism.

816
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,999
Do you think you'll have your way?

817
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,758
Will you let me go...
if I let you hit me until you feel better?

818
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:38,926
Of course not.

819
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:42,055
I'm going to make you pay for your sins,
even if that means...

820
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,641
I must change the laws
of the divine realm.

821
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,434
I never committed any sins!

822
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,731
Yes.

823
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,736
That's what it is. The fact
that you don't know what you did.

824
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,529
That's my reason.

825
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,492
I hate myself because of you.

826
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,161
That's what's driving me so crazy.

827
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,999
And I've already told you my last reason.

828
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,584
I just hate you.

829
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,267
Jingeon, I won't forgive you
if you interfere.

830
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,940
I can't give you a single penny,
so get lost.

831
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,067
-It's the King's order.
-Whatever.

832
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,111
Does the King have the right
to steal money?

833
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,905
I shall punish you
when I return to the Land of Water.

834
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,742
Sure. Just know that I'll freeze
and crush your tongue before you do that.

835
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,162
I can't beg because I'm a king.

836
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,417
That's not the only thing you can't do.
You can't do anything in this world.

837
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,924
-Yes?
-<i>Where are you?</i>

838
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,010
<i>Bin... Ahn Bin is...</i>

839
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,262
What's wrong?

840
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,432
<i>Bin just took Mr. Shin.</i>
<i>He just took him against his will.</i>

841
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,016
What are you talking about? Slow down.

842
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,230
What's up?

843
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,891
-Let's stop.
-No.

844
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,477
Neither of us can die anyway,

845
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,104
so we should fight
until one of us is close to dying.

846
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,230
You're wrong.

847
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,984
Have you forgotten? I'm capable of...

848
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:01,903
killing you guys.

849
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,198
Isn't that why you suggested
we fight without using our powers?

850
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,697
Jingeon.

851
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,659
I told you to stay out of this!

852
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:06,884
You're...

853
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,683
Yes. Do you get it now?

854
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,853
Do you remember who you killed?

855
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,855
Do you now realize what your sin is?

856
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,287
<i>Why have you kept it from me</i>
<i>all this time?</i>

857
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,497
I shouldn't have gone.
I've regretted it thousands of times.

858
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,208
<i>Let it go.</i>
<i>I know something is weighing on your mind.</i>

859
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,294
<i>-He's like you guys, isn't he?</i>
<i>-He's not like us.</i>

860
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:26,380
<i>Ms. Yun, did we perhaps cross paths</i>
<i>in the past?</i>

861
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,633
<i>I told you to keep in mind</i>
<i>that I can be very jealous</i>

862
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,009
<i>of your male friends.</i>

863
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,218
<i>Is this also jealousy?</i>

864
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,471
<i>Just let him have her.</i>
<i>That'll be better for her too.</i>

865
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,473
<i>-Mr. Shin.</i>
<i>-That can't be.</i>

866
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,557
-Look at me.
-Let go of me!

867
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,351
-Stay still.
-<i>Are you with him right now?</i>

868
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,478
<i>-Did something happen?</i>
<i>-Come home now.</i>
