1
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>When something fades in the sun,</i>
<i>it becomes history.</i>

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>And when something soaks up the moonlight,</i>

3
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>it becomes a myth.</i>

4
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>That means our story will become a myth.</i>

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,025
Well, we're being really romantic
right now, you know.

6
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,694
But why is it that I keep
thinking about that thing?

7
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,072
About what?

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,365
The seafood noodles
I told you about earlier.

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,744
I keep ruining the mood
by thinking about how

10
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,121
there were 12 clams
in the bowl of noodles.

11
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,461
My mom and dad kept arguing
even at the restaurant.

12
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,379
I was on pins and needles,

13
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,049
so I kept counting the clams
in the noodles.

14
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,177
There were 12 of them.
"There are so many of them.

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,764
Dad, there are 12 clams in this."

16
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,766
I wanted to say that,

17
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,103
but my mom kept lashing out
at my dad nonstop.

18
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,522
What was so important?

19
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,193
My dad said nothing and just kept quiet.

20
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,403
That got her riled up even more,

21
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,364
so she said whatever came to mind.

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,576
And I kept counting the clams
over and over.

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,538
No matter how many times I counted,
there were 12 of them.

24
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,378
What do you think...

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,549
was so important to my dad?

26
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,761
<i>You said you're a god.</i>

27
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,139
Then grant me a wish.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,850
Let me meet my dad.

29
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,562
I want to ask him why he had to dump
all of these burdens on me

30
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,730
and if he's been able to sleep at night

31
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,276
and eat well since leaving me. I want
to tell him to take them all from me.

32
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,319
He couldn't even save his own daughter.

33
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,197
How is he going to save the world?
If I could ask him that question...

34
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,576
I'd have nothing more to wish for.

35
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,538
-Have you tried to look for him?
-No, I haven't.

36
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,791
What if I do and find him here in Korea?

37
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,963
If he never visited us, even though
he's been here the whole time...

38
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,674
then what should I do?

39
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,093
How do you feel now?

40
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,723
Is that really your wish?

41
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,351
Meeting your dad and telling him
everything you've wanted to say to him?

42
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,525
I think so.

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,822
What is it?

44
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,157
Nothing.

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,501
This is nice.

46
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,627
What's nice?

47
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,672
Do you know why people get married?

48
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,967
It's because they don't want to part ways
after a whole day of fun together.

49
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,303
But we live together,
so we don't have to part ways.

50
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,223
It's nice to live together.

51
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,310
Do gods get married too?

52
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,897
I could say they do.
But then again, I could say they don't.

53
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,482
What does that mean?

54
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,776
You can get married if you want to.

55
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,696
But it's neither exclusive,
nor does it have any binding power.

56
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,532
What? Come again? If that's the case,

57
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,034
can both parties cheat on each other
whenever they want to?

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,912
It's very freewheeling.

59
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,624
That's why people are unsure
who Lady Yuhwa's mother is.

60
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,210
Who is Lady Yuhwa?

61
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,297
Your daughter.

62
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,258
Ju-mong's mother
and King Yuri's maternal grandmother.

63
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,468
You're King Yuri's maternal grandfather,
so she's your wife.

64
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,554
-I've never been married.
-Whatever.

65
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,264
Don't even try to pretend.

66
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,988
You look like you're sulking.

67
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,823
What did you just say?

68
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,366
Give me a glass of water.

69
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,914
I mean, why do laws and systems exist?

70
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,043
Their power comes
from their legally binding force.

71
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,213
What? "Freewheeling"?
Gosh, is it like <i>Animal Kingdom</i> or what?

72
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,257
Is it because they're all
Mr. and Ms. Nature?

73
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
By any chance,

74
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,029
is polygamy practiced
in the world of gods?

75
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,697
How did you know?

76
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,533
There are even some goddesses
who have many husbands.

77
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,495
-Are you serious?
-Isn't it obvious?

78
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,080
We neither grow old nor die.

79
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,208
How can we be expected
to be faithful to only one person?

80
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,543
What's wrong?

81
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,213
Then in your case,

82
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,423
how many times have you been married?

83
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,386
-I told you I've never been married.
-Then what about Lady Yuhwa...

84
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,179
Come to your senses, woman.

85
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,140
Get me another glass of water.

86
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,986
One more glass.

87
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,793
Look.

88
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,712
What are you doing now?

89
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,423
Can't you see?

90
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,049
I don't want to go to bed.

91
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,342
What?

92
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,930
If you don't want to go to bed,

93
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,516
what do you want to do?

94
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,395
Namsuri said he's working all night.

95
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,814
Great timing.

96
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,194
-So?
-So...

97
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,657
I'd like to...

98
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,959
I'd like to watch some TV with you.

99
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,794
-TV?
-Sit down.

100
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,089
<i>He looks unfamiliar.</i>

101
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,549
<i>He's new.</i>

102
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,844
<i>Introduce him to me. Who is he?</i>
<i>Hey, what's your name?</i>

103
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,513
<i>-Hey, come here.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

104
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,598
<i>-Have we met?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

105
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,268
-So-a.
-Yes?

106
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,412
What did you see this time?

107
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,997
-I read your diary.
-What?

108
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,749
What did you say?

109
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,544
Not everyone gets to lie on my lap.

110
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,462
Why would you read someone else's diary?

111
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,256
I thought it was written for me

112
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,966
two decades ago.

113
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,259
What?

114
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,262
I read a poem
you wrote when you were little.

115
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,972
It's titled <i>Daddy's Lap.</i>

116
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,224
"Daddy's lap is mine.

117
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,934
Go away, Sang-yu.

118
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,435
Daddy's lap is mine.

119
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,563
Curse you, Sang-yu."
Do you call that a poem?

120
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,607
You said you were an amazing poet
when you were little.

121
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,161
-Isn't there a rerun of<i> The Divine Dinner?</i>
-Hey, I know what you're thinking.

122
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,001
If I had your amazing powers,

123
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,296
I'd take charge of cooking
until the day I leave.

124
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,391
When do you plan to leave?

125
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,184
A messenger will come.

126
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,438
It could be tomorrow, right?

127
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,321
We don't know
when we will have to part ways.

128
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,533
When I was an intern,

129
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:23,122
I saw a number of terminally ill patients
and their families,

130
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,209
and I felt guilty for some reason
whenever I saw them.

131
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,381
I obviously couldn't fully understand
how they were feeling.

132
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,261
I just tried to comfort them
the way I was taught to,

133
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,058
but I had no idea what was really
going through their minds.

134
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,936
It might have been a better idea
to just cry with them.

135
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,689
But instead, I poured out
a bunch of irresponsible words.

136
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,610
Still, I learned something.

137
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,739
I got to see people
preparing for goodbyes...

138
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,993
and what gets left after those goodbyes.

139
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,166
Whether it's for the rest of the family
or for themselves,

140
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,504
they would find a reason
why they must not wither away,

141
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,132
and their wandering minds...

142
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,346
would find a place to stay in the end.

143
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,231
Can I ask you something?

144
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,819
What about you?

145
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,282
How do you cope?

146
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,162
I have 40 to 50 years left to live
at most.

147
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,457
But your life never ends.

148
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,588
Can I...

149
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,550
be greedy?

150
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,515
Can I ask you to remember me...

151
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,936
for as long as you can?

152
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,638
What are you doing?

153
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,723
You're up.

154
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,684
I woke up early and had nothing to do,

155
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,187
so I watched a rerun of <i>The Divine Dinner.</i>

156
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,524
And?

157
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,320
And what?

158
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,738
Come on.

159
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,618
Are you making breakfast for me?

160
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,372
I found a guy who makes breakfast for me.

161
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,542
-I'm only doing this because I'm hungry.
-Really?

162
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,838
Then I'll just go back to sleep.

163
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,550
I don't usually eat breakfast.

164
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,426
Sit down.

165
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,138
My stomach gets upset if I have breakfast.

166
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,392
Sit down.

167
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,229
I'll go wash first

168
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,940
so that I can pay my respects
to this special breakfast.

169
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,495
He's so cute, but I can't tell him.

170
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,706
He'd get so angry.

171
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,293
Should I just try?

172
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,670
What if he turns into something else?

173
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,572
This is too much for breakfast.

174
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,824
Who's going to eat all this food?

175
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,786
Do you know that food waste--

176
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,414
Just say you're happy. That'd be simpler.

177
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,252
Have a seat.

178
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,094
Let's eat.

179
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,891
Dig in.

180
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,186
So, this is how it feels...

181
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,148
when someone cooks for you.

182
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,243
Eat.

183
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457
Let's eat.

184
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,132
I locked the door
but couldn't find any flower pots.

185
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,902
He came to give me back the keys.
He couldn't find the pot.

186
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,320
I thought hard about what to do.

187
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,531
You wouldn't be coming to the clinic
for a while.

188
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,033
I couldn't decide whether
I should have them delivered to you

189
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,410
or ask you to meet up with me.

190
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,038
-You can't do that.
-I know. That's why I came here.

191
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,710
-Would you like some tea?
-It's too early for tea.

192
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,545
There is no such rule.

193
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,922
In my house, there is.

194
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,134
We don't drink tea in the morning here.

195
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,014
We have breakfast instead.
If you haven't eaten, have some breakfast.

196
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,684
Mr. Shin is very busy--

197
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,936
Then I shall join you for breakfast.

198
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,980
Goodness gracious.

199
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,612
Ms. Yun, you're a good cook.

200
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,905
I cooked.

201
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,324
She didn't do anything.

202
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,910
I made all the food.

203
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,289
-Is that so?
-I guess you don't know.

204
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,333
She's a terrible cook.

205
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,086
And she can sleep anywhere.

206
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,838
She falls asleep right away.

207
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,173
That's why...

208
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,259
I always have to...

209
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,387
carry her to her bed, every night.

210
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,057
She's such a handful.

211
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:39,933
There's more.

212
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,186
She can't even turn on the light
at the door.

213
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,354
That's why I always turn it on for her.

214
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,107
Also, she rarely cleans.
That's why I clean her place for her.

215
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,779
I take a warm bath every morning.

216
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,073
It doesn't suit her,

217
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,407
but she gets so shy

218
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,077
whenever she sees me naked.

219
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,787
Hey, look.

220
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,164
Am I wrong?

221
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,751
You said you just can't get used to it.

222
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,294
Hey, please.

223
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,378
Am I wrong?

224
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,217
Did you say you never get sick of it?

225
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,888
Let's eat.

226
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,474
You two live together,

227
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,393
so you seem to know a lot
about each other.

228
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,523
Oh, right. Ms. Yun.

229
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,650
About your new landlord...

230
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,276
It's me.

231
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,403
Are you serious?

232
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,323
Is it really true?

233
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,993
Is that why we got our rent
and deposit lowered?

234
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,745
I told you...

235
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,748
that I'd just buy the whole building.

236
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,501
I told you that I have a lot of money.

237
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,962
A building owner...

238
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,172
Thank you so much.

239
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,133
I'm hugely indebted to you.

240
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,218
Not at all.

241
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:01,223
I did it for all the tenants
in my building.

242
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,019
Chairman Shin has been too greedy,
so they've all been pretty stressed out.

243
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,604
Thank you very much.

244
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,523
I'm so relieved now.

245
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,066
Please don't mention it.

246
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,696
I should be a good landlord.

247
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,198
You're already such a wonderful landlord--

248
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,449
I'm a king!

249
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,204
I am...

250
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,666
a king.

251
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,011
I like how the house shows traces of time.

252
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,929
I was born in this house.

253
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,931
Although half of it is owned
by the bank now.

254
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,691
It's okay.

255
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,985
It's all right.

256
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,529
Stay still.

257
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,325
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes?

258
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,493
Are you sure we never met in the past?

259
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,413
Yes, as far as I remember.

260
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,957
Then why do I keep...

261
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,001
How dare you try to pull this trick?

262
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,555
Have a seat.
In my house, we drink tea after each meal.

263
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,015
That's the rule here.

264
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,770
Make some tea for us.

265
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,944
What is this? He's trying hard
to look patriarchal, but it's so awkward.

266
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,036
What a heavenly sight.

267
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,372
The God of Water,
who's the ruler of the divine world,

268
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,123
and a demigod.

269
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,265
Why did he get changed?

270
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,767
I want it in my cup.

271
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,313
I have my own cup. I call it Yongyong.

272
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,774
A master and his servant
are both drawn on it.

273
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,442
The design is very artistic.

274
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,444
I worked a part-time job

275
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,113
and bought it for her.

276
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,448
I want this in my cup.

277
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,744
Well, you should just drink it
in this today.

278
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,582
I'll do that if that's what you want.

279
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,463
I should go wash the dishes.

280
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,260
You two look lovely together.

281
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,429
Then why are you here?

282
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,306
The keys?

283
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,684
That childish trick of yours
won't even faze me.

284
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,519
Even if you can't outdo your rival,

285
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,105
he may reveal his shortcomings
if you keep throwing jabs at him.

286
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,106
Like I've told you,

287
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,817
waiting is my specialty.

288
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,196
You'll spend the rest of your life
realizing how futile that wait is,

289
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,825
and you'll think that
this lifetime of yours is an epic fail.

290
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,662
I envy that confidence of yours.

291
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:12,998
I'm a king.

292
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,378
Ms. Yun told me that I should never be
intimidated by others' backgrounds.

293
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,880
That's pointless.

294
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,008
Anyhow, time is on my side.

295
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,969
And come to think of it,
money is also on my side.

296
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,889
-I'm a king.
-I own a building.

297
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,768
What would be more powerful
between money and a king here?

298
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,436
-Shall we see?
-What?

299
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,776
-Ms. Yun.
-Yes?

300
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,988
You've forgotten about the shift
at the farm in two days, right?

301
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,825
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,453
This isn't good.

303
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,830
We are friends,
but we also have a contract.

304
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,792
I'm really sorry.
I've been all over the place.

305
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,294
Well...
You'll leave in the afternoon, right?

306
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,630
-Then I'll also--
-Where do you think you're going?

307
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,884
I don't know what this is about,
but you can't take her, no matter what.

308
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,887
She's indebted to me.

309
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,431
When she broke the land contract,
she agreed to pay the penalty.

310
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,016
She must earn money and pay me back

311
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,936
in order to fulfill her obligations
and end the contract.

312
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,398
I'll see you then.

313
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,119
This is all because you didn't allow me
to sell the land.

314
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,959
Give me some money.

315
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,294
Our servant didn't sell her land
to that halfie,

316
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,171
so she now has to pay him a penalty.

317
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,298
She owes him money because of us, so--

318
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,719
What a joke.

319
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,934
It sounds like that was Habaek
on the phone.

320
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,727
It looks like Mr. Shin
is doing a great job.

321
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,604
He's doing
what the life coach told him to do.

322
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,440
I don't want to hear that name yet.

323
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,150
Try not to bring him up.

324
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,528
No, I'll keep talking about him
until you get sick of it.

325
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,657
What is this about?

326
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,036
I heard that women dream
of having breakfast

327
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,913
made by men they love.

328
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,957
Only foolish humans
would dream of such a thing.

329
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,126
Try to think like a human
for a few minutes, then.

330
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,378
Shouldn't it be
with the man I love, though?

331
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,007
How many more steps
do I have to take? 50 or 100?

332
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,678
Will I be able to get there?

333
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,638
Get out. I'm going to take a shower.

334
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,056
All right, then.

335
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,277
She's the most difficult woman
to deal with.

336
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,322
I know that, of course.

337
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,873
Habaek.

338
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,959
Not today.

339
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,086
My schedule is fully packed.

340
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,714
I'll call you.

341
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,638
When I return to the divine realm,

342
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,848
I'll be sure to turn
one of you into a saury

343
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,226
and the other one into a sparrow.

344
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,613
<i>Yes, My Lord.</i>

345
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,158
Money. Are you earning a lot of it?

346
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,118
<i>Pardon me? Yes.</i>

347
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,287
<i>My duck boat is swamped</i>
<i>with customers now.</i>

348
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,456
<i>Oh, right. Lord Judong called.</i>

349
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,708
What? Where is he?

350
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,377
-Why isn't he back yet?
-<i>He'll be back soon.</i>

351
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,170
<i>He said you shouldn't go anywhere</i>
<i>and wait for him.</i>

352
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,507
But why did he call you?

353
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,716
He could've called me.

354
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,677
<i>He said Lady Mura told him not to call you</i>

355
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,679
<i>because you keep asking for money.</i>

356
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,472
How dare she.

357
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,609
He is...

358
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,778
He's the one who saved me.

359
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,197
It was him.

360
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,032
But...

361
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,413
What? What are you talking about now?

362
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,591
What was that about?

363
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,219
"He saved me." That was all good.

364
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,098
But she said, "But."

365
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,475
That's what keeps bothering me.

366
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,647
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

367
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,191
My co-worker who has the shift
after mine was late.

368
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,319
-Namsuri.
-Yes?

369
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,112
I keep having the same dream,

370
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,697
and I can't ignore it.

371
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,074
I never hear the most important part.

372
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,412
Is there anything I can do?

373
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,173
I don't know.

374
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,677
Why? Gosh!

375
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,689
<i>-Hey, what's up?</i>
-Is everything all right with you?

376
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,566
What's this about?

377
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,402
It sounds like
you want there to be some problems.

378
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,447
My friend, you've become bitter
after a bad relationship.

379
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,658
My relationship wasn't bad.

380
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,285
<i>Then there must be something wrong</i>
<i>with your dating style.</i>

381
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,537
You love in order to say goodbye?
That's nonsense.

382
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,123
<i>Some people say they break up</i>
<i>even though they love each other.</i>

383
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,459
<i>But no one loves in order to break up.</i>

384
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,961
You left out "properly."

385
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,005
It's to break up properly.

386
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,176
-I have to go.
-Hold on.

387
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,804
How's he doing?
That boyfriend of yours who saved you.

388
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,394
Who is in such a ridiculous relationship?

389
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,751
You know it won't work.
Why are you trying so hard?

390
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,296
Do you have to pay interest
when you borrow money?

391
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,177
I'll pay you a lot of interest
when I'm back in the Land of Water.

392
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,556
Who needs money in the divine realm?

393
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,183
I'm not talking about money.

394
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,018
Tell me if you need anything.

395
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,729
Can you even give up the throne for me?

396
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,941
It's not like I want that.

397
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,821
I might not like you,
but I don't want that kind of tragedy.

398
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,741
I'd like you to be around for a long time.

399
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,033
So, is that a no?

400
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,538
I could give you anything,
be it money or diamonds.

401
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,248
But Mura doesn't like that.

402
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,917
I listen to my girl.

403
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,880
On the internet,

404
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,133
people call someone like you "a pushover."

405
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:23,303
I don't have a problem with that.

406
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,932
I'm off.

407
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,434
Hold on.

408
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,480
-I have something to ask you.
-What?

409
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,236
What is it?

410
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:44,908
What is...

411
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,243
Mura like?

412
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,288
Did you... meet Habaek?

413
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,124
Did you attack his weak point?

414
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,002
It's not like that.

415
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,297
Good. Show him how superior you are

416
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,508
and how weak he is
here in the human world.

417
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,092
Do you really mean it?

418
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,677
I can't let him go like this.

419
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,055
He has to become a wreck.

420
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,307
By the time he leaves,

421
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,309
he has to become a total wreck.

422
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,648
You guys are so extreme.

423
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:22,111
<i>Mura is the most loyal among us,</i>
<i>as you already know.</i>

424
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,948
But once she turns her back on someone,
that's it.

425
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,157
Then why did you do that?

426
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,450
I'm an exception.

427
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,453
Mura and I are beyond that.

428
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,081
I came to the wrong person.

429
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,750
You don't know Mura well.

430
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,795
You want to know
what she really thinks, right?

431
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,718
You're really something.

432
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,096
You're clueless, yet you know everything.

433
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,056
You know everything,
yet you don't know anything.

434
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,560
That's why I say
I'm different from you guys.

435
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,353
Fine, you're right.

436
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,273
I can't figure you out.

437
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,485
No one can ever know how far you can go.

438
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,695
If you pay me...

439
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,489
I'll give you advice.

440
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,706
Those heartless punks. Are they serious?

441
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,839
Where are you going?

442
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,259
Work. I have to pay off my penalty.

443
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,469
I told you not to go.

444
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,184
I'm sorry. He insisted on tagging along.

445
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,938
He's a good worker.

446
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,444
I don't know everything
about the world of gods,

447
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,155
but considering
what I've heard about Habaek,

448
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,115
this is unbelievable.

449
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,288
I can see why Hye-ra is so bothered.

450
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,582
He thinks he can pay off
the penalty that way.

451
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,711
I told him I get paid for my daily work,
but he wouldn't even listen.

452
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,463
Maybe he doesn't understand daily pay.

453
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,925
If he didn't, I could explain to him.

454
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,718
But he knows what it is.

455
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,722
Apparently, he read about a chairman
of some company on the internet.

456
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,474
A mere chairman earns
500 million won a day.

457
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,477
As the emperor of all gods,
my labor is invaluable and priceless.

458
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,064
But I'll give him the honor
of putting a price on my labor.

459
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,440
Let's go.

460
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,904
So how much does the King think
his labor is worth?

461
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,741
He said 50 billion won.

462
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,077
I see, 50 billion won?

463
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,748
He wants you to pay him the remainder
after deducting the penalty.

464
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,215
So, 50 billion won?

465
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,634
You now seem to understand
the power of money.

466
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,678
Your strategy was clumsy, though.

467
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,809
Do you think I wouldn't have a chance

468
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,019
if So-a had enough money?

469
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,940
Whether she has money or not,
you'll never have a place in her heart.

470
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,693
You know too little about her.

471
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,277
You think so?

472
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,363
Then let me tell you...

473
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,116
something you don't know.

474
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,493
I doubt there is anything.

475
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,661
There is.

476
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,038
It's something you don't know
because you're a god.

477
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,083
I know it because I'm human.

478
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,503
What?

479
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,880
You see...

480
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,386
humans are lonely
from the moment they're born.

481
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,404
Jingeon. What is it?

482
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,494
Someone came by.

483
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,289
-Who?
-He left something for you.

484
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,749
-What is it?
-Give me your hand.

485
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,126
All right. Thank you.

486
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,107
This will be planted somewhere else.
I went to the wrong spot.

487
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,818
-Let me help you.
-It's okay.

488
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,739
Go check on him.

489
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,450
It's okay. He's not a kid.

490
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,037
The gods in the Land of Water
would be shocked to hear that.

491
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,205
A kid?

492
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,542
I'm really curious.

493
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,877
Is he such a big deal?

494
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,713
I don't know.

495
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,591
The cave was my whole world.

496
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,887
But when Jugeollin told me
about the divine world,

497
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,723
half of it was about Habaek.

498
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,978
Imprisoned in the cave, I thought
of Habaek as the god of all gods.

499
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,604
The god of all gods?

500
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,315
Not all gods have the same powers.

501
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,404
Some powers are only allowed
to certain gods.

502
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,408
Habaek could do everything.

503
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,618
He was born to be king.

504
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,913
But there are two things
even Habaek can't do.

505
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,958
He can't revive the dead.

506
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,251
Also...

507
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,463
he doesn't have the ability I have.

508
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,843
Still,
Habaek isn't intimidated by me at all.

509
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,220
To be honest, I liked that about him.

510
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,101
By the way,

511
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,645
are you really okay?

512
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,191
He could go back as soon as tomorrow.

513
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,529
He might be gone when you wake up.

514
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,699
He came back

515
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,951
so that I can move on with my life

516
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,661
even if that happens.

517
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:02,762
Are you done?

518
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,014
Yes.

519
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,142
I want my 50 billion won.
Tell him I'm giving him a discount.

520
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,561
Give me that.

521
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,315
What are you doing? This is so unlike you.

522
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,608
Why is it unlike me?

523
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,903
You still have a lot to learn.

524
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,198
Shall I show you the vast scope
of my chameleon-like charms?

525
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:24,992
Don't.

526
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,328
Don't do that.

527
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,539
Hold tightly onto your chest
so that your heart doesn't burst.

528
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,208
I said, don't do it.

529
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,600
Gosh, seriously!

530
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,602
I told you not to do it.

531
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,397
How do you feel?

532
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,274
Isn't your heart racing?

533
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,192
Browsing on the internet

534
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,444
taught me
that human women call this "sexy."

535
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,241
Oh, boy.

536
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,166
Bend down, please.

537
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,754
Why did you do that all of a sudden?

538
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,424
-Is your heart okay?
-My heart is totally fine,

539
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,676
but I'm cringing so badly right now.

540
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,305
Come here.
Let's have you sit on that chair.

541
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,652
Why do you keep acting
out of character today?

542
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,070
Isn't it like how...

543
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,365
you peeked at me from behind
in front of the house that day?

544
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,366
What?

545
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,661
You said you still have
40 to 50 years left to live.

546
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,081
Then you should have...

547
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,584
more memories of me...

548
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,754
so that you won't run out of them.

549
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,801
You're so good at saying
things like that nonchalantly.

550
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,351
I'm not saying this because I don't care.

551
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,621
You know that I'm selfish, right?

552
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,793
I'm telling you this because I'm selfish.

553
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,046
Try your best...

554
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,925
not to be lonely...

555
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,471
for as long as you can.

556
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,400
I will...

557
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,822
remember you for a long time.

558
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,851
Are you mad that
he didn't pay you 50 billion won?

559
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,649
He promised you that
he'll pay you five million won a day.

560
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,610
You should work there every single day.
If you work there for ten days,

561
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,779
you'll earn more than enough
to pay off the penalty.

562
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,698
If the two of us earn money together...

563
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,869
That actually sounded so funny.

564
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,877
Let's go back there tomorrow
and the day after as well.

565
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,214
The two of us should go there every day.

566
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,052
Let's work together.

567
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,142
Let's stay together.

568
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,396
All right.

569
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,098
Where have you been?

570
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,312
Why do you look like that?

571
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,813
Why are you here?

572
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,024
I have good news for you.

573
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,196
Congratulations.

574
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,618
Oh, I got this made according
to the customs here.

575
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,328
Such formality does matter, you know.

576
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,206
I even picked my dress
to coordinate with this color.

577
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,751
I figured I should make this much effort
when I deliver this kind of news to you.

578
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,797
The messenger must've been busy.

579
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,966
He left without even delivering this
to you in person.

580
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,227
The sixth red tide has come,

581
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,438
so please get ready, Lord Habaek.

582
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,902
The details are inside.

583
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,737
I kept them simple

584
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,323
and wrote them in big letters
so that you can read them easily.

585
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,704
I'm off.

586
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,088
Let me say this just in case.

587
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,094
You know what will happen...

588
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,597
if you don't return, right?

589
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,313
Let's go in.

590
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,235
Come on.

591
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,154
Let's eat something. I'm hungry.

592
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,933
Come and eat.

593
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,897
You actually look pretty dashing
even from behind.

594
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,493
Come on.

595
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:29,143
It's not like you didn't know.
Why do you look so sad?

596
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,188
They're not asking you to return tomorrow.

597
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,407
Why do you never tell me not to leave...

598
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,161
even if you don't mean it?

599
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:51,874
Why is that?

600
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,587
Will you not go back
if I ask you not to leave?

601
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,006
No.

602
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,675
I can't do that.

603
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,553
See? Exactly.

604
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,638
Don't sound me out like that.

605
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,726
I'm not the kind of woman
who holds men back.

606
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,660
I'll tell you why I'm not stopping you.

607
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,330
Think about it.

608
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,208
You're only cool because
you're the king of the divine world.

609
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,502
Here, you're not a king. You'll be
nothing here without your powers.

610
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,421
You'd just be a jobless guy
who likes taking warm baths.

611
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,925
You don't like to work.
You're only interested in driving cars.

612
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,177
I'd have to earn money
and take care of you.

613
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,933
Don't watch those kinds of movies
where the main characters

614
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,018
fall in love and say
they don't care about money.

615
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,563
When men behave that way,
their ladies give up on them.

616
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,037
My goodness.

617
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,416
Jeez, how is he going to be a king

618
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,002
with such a sensitive heart?

619
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,744
Lord Habaek.

620
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,503
-I'm back.
-Why are you back so late?

621
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,172
I can work at so many places
now that I have a government-issued ID.

622
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,758
The 24-hour barbecue place asked me
to cover a shift today.

623
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,094
In the afternoon,
I worked on the duck boat--

624
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,929
-Quit all your jobs.
-Pardon?

625
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,180
I've received the message.

626
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,891
Does that mean we're going back now?

627
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,395
Notify your employers in advance
so that the same thing won't happen again.

628
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,354
Okay.

629
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,218
Are you that happy?

630
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,930
You should've seen the look on his face.

631
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,434
-I thought the sky was going to collapse.
-Habaek must've really gotten

632
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,185
on your bad side.

633
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,688
I even thought about not telling him
about the message

634
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,858
so that he'd be able
to just stay here forever.

635
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,446
That's a bit harsh
even if you only said it out of anger.

636
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,740
Habaek will perish
if he doesn't ascend the throne.

637
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,492
Will you be able to live without him?

638
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,870
And Habaek knows that too.

639
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,456
This isn't about him being torn
about whether he should go back.

640
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,625
So just cut him some slack.

641
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,669
You annoy me so much.

642
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,298
Who do you like more? Me or Habaek?

643
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,343
PLEASE BE MINE, HYE-RA

644
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,179
Tell me. Who do you like more?

645
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,223
Hey. You...

646
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,894
What?

647
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,775
Me? Not Habaek?

648
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,901
Yes, I'm talking to you.

649
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,364
-What's that?
-What?

650
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,743
PLEASE BE MINE, HYE-RA

651
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,370
This?

652
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,958
-It's a gift from your fans.
-What?

653
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,711
I heard you got angry at your fans
and told them not to send gifts.

654
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,422
They're so scared of you
that they've stopped sending gifts.

655
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,008
Well, yes.

656
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,677
But, apparently, a handful of them
keep sending you gifts.

657
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,429
Mr. Kim didn't know what to do with them,

658
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,640
so I told him I'd take them.

659
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,642
I like anything that has your face on it.

660
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,613
I'LL PROTECT YOU, HYE-RA
ONE AND ONLY BEAUTY, HYE-RA

661
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,368
By the way,
about that gift box in your room...

662
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,497
Yes, that one.
I ate some snacks from that box.

663
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,166
Okay, good.

664
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,836
By the way,

665
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,588
-why do you have that?
-What?

666
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:15,507
Well...

667
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:20,178
I told Mr. Kim to throw everything away.
He must've put it back here again.

668
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,014
What would he know?

669
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,144
You're a goddess,
so you don't need human beings' love.

670
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,814
This pair of socks
would look like a joke to you.

671
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,899
You even looked down
on my diamonds, you know.

672
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,693
Right.

673
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:42,159
Only lowly human beings
care about these stupid things.

674
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,578
There. I'll take it.

675
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,830
I like it because it has your face on it.

676
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,665
What are you doing?

677
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,460
Where are you going?

678
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,130
Do you want to come with me?

679
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,807
This is it.

680
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,895
The place where I made a foolish mistake.

681
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:57,317
It was 11:35 p.m. on December 20, 2004.

682
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,278
I even remember the exact time.

683
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,033
<i>After my dad left,</i>

684
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:09,246
<i>I studied very hard</i>
<i>in order to become happy.</i>

685
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,415
<i>It was just like what you told me.</i>

686
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,836
<i>I only believed what I wanted to believe.</i>

687
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:21,633
<i>Like you said, it made things</i>
<i>much easier to cope with.</i>

688
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,095
Your dad abandoned us.
Just think of it that way.

689
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,973
<i>Had I not done that, I would've</i>
<i>had to spend my entire youth</i>

690
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,808
<i>trying to understand my dad.</i>

691
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:31,935
<i>But...</i>

692
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,982
<i>even my mom was struggling</i>
<i>to endure the hardship behind my back.</i>

693
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,735
<i>I really hated her.</i>

694
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,740
I was doing a good job of hanging in there
even after my mom died.

695
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,993
Even that day,

696
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,663
I had a perfectly normal day at school.

697
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,541
But, suddenly...

698
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,711
this strange feeling took me over.

699
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,965
It suddenly came to me,

700
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,510
instantly took over my thoughts,

701
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,431
and led me to this bridge.

702
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:18,106
"Why didn't God save any love for me...

703
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,236
when there's so much love in this world?

704
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,906
Why did God leave me out?

705
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:29,951
Why...

706
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,623
Why does God only hate me?"

707
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,132
<i>I told myself I'd think God still loves me</i>

708
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,425
<i>if my dad picked up...</i>

709
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,553
<i>and that I'd think...</i>

710
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,597
<i>God really hates me</i>

711
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,182
-<i>if he didn't pick up.</i>
-Dad...

712
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,976
<i>That was my conclusion.</i>

713
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,519
Please...

714
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:06,529
<i>The person you are trying to reach</i>
<i>is unavailable. Please leave a message.</i>

715
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,659
<i>My dad's cell phone never turned on again.</i>

716
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:20,251
<i>So I decided to take revenge on him</i>
<i>in the most terrible way.</i>

717
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,589
I'm going to make you regret this
for the rest of your life.

718
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:35,683
<i>Of course, it just ended up becoming</i>
<i>my most embarrassing memory.</i>

719
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,566
And once again...

720
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:48,113
I have to say goodbye to someone I love.

721
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,284
I wanted to know how I really feel.

722
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,746
I wanted to know...

723
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,542
if I'd still feel like I did
when I jumped from this bridge...

724
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,420
or...

725
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,674
if I've matured into a real adult.

726
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,844
I wanted to check.

727
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,102
Thank you...

728
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,855
for loving me.

729
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,343
Let's go home and eat something.

730
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,854
So this is better than the other proposal.

731
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:08,026
Hey, I've been giving it some thought,
and I can't figure out your intentions.

732
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,112
What happened to you?

733
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,655
"A decent human being"?

734
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,116
I'm a human being
who has 22 pairs of autosomes

735
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,869
and one pair of X chromosomes.

736
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,246
But you told me to become a human being,

737
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,166
so I thought there could be
a hidden message behind that.

738
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,669
So I even ended up studying
the DNA sequence.

739
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,635
Don't you see the steam
coming off my head?

740
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,846
And I took countless pills
to get rid of my headache.

741
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,682
It's been a while since I graduated,
so I forgot everything!

742
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,227
Why did you make me
study everything again?

743
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,105
Ja-ya.

744
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,899
What's wrong with you?

745
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,027
He looks down on me.

746
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,781
I know he goes to church,
but why is he trying to make me study?

747
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,033
Did my grandpa put you up to this?

748
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,869
That's what happened, right?
How much did he pay you?

749
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,540
Did you receive money?

750
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,084
Hey, say something.
You got money from him, right?

751
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,920
How much did you get? Did you get a lot?

752
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,756
Let go!

753
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,800
Are you stupid?

754
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,677
What does the DNA sequence

755
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,762
have to do with kicking Ms. Yun
out of the building?

756
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:21,724
That's exactly what I want to ask you.
Do you have feelings for So-a?

757
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,394
Ja-ya.

758
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,105
You should quit your job.

759
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,567
Your job requires intelligence,

760
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,402
but it also requires you
to have a big heart.

761
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,153
What?

762
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,116
I'm not interested
in becoming a sexy celebrity.

763
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:44,664
You should learn to have a bigger heart
and become a decent human being.

764
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,127
"A bigger heart"?

765
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,087
"A decent human being"?

766
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,881
Why is the list getting longer?

767
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,681
THE ONE AND ONLY, HYE-RA

768
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,647
What's wrong?
Is this your first time seeing me topless?

769
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:14,527
Is that towel from one of my fans as well?

770
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,115
Yes, it's really nice.
It has your name on it.

771
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,347
My gosh, what's wrong with him?

772
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,974
I don't even have a lot of them.

773
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,659
HYE-RA IS MINE

774
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,163
What are you doing?

775
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,165
Hey, this is so moisturizing.

776
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,084
You...

777
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,586
What?

778
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:21,803
What's wrong?

779
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,055
-Is that--
-Are you angry

780
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,432
-because I'm using these gifts from--
-No.

781
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,644
-Why would I be angry?
-Didn't you say you hate...

782
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:33,648
-getting gifts from humans?
-Yes, I hate them. They're filthy.

783
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,820
Just tell your fans
that they can send you gifts again.

784
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,322
Why are you being so stubborn
for no reason?

785
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,033
-It's all pointless.
-What do you know?

786
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,254
I didn't know anything until a moment ago,

787
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,630
but now I do.

788
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,808
The design isn't that pretty.

789
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,566
Do I have 50 or 100 more steps left?

790
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,986
Or could I already be inside her heart?

791
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,323
I'll try confronting your true feelings.

792
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:36,794
Get lost.

793
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:49,348
Okay.

794
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,769
I guess she's not that interested
in a diamond ring.

795
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,353
Let's get her a gold ring.

796
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,063
A gold ring.

797
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,870
What brings you here at this hour?
What's wrong?

798
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,373
I finally solved the last puzzle.

799
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,291
What?

800
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,460
I told you that I keep seeing you
in my dreams.

801
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,295
You're here to talk about that again?

802
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,172
Come in for some food
since you're here anyway.

803
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:24,509
-Food isn't important right now.
-No, that's all I care about right now.

804
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,052
It would've been better without you,

805
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,805
but I can't turn away
my one and only friend.

806
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,725
But you really are a nuisance.

807
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,602
I told you, didn't I?

808
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,853
At first, all I could see

809
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,898
was a blurry image of someone coming up
to me and saying something.

810
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,901
For some reason, I felt like it was you.
But guess what?

811
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,529
A few days later, you came to me
soaked in the rain, but I still

812
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:45,947
couldn't hear what you were saying.

813
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,658
But a few days ago,
I could finally hear you.

814
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,285
He is...

815
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:54,121
Yes, go on. Who are you talking about?

816
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,832
He is...

817
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,422
He's the one who saved me.

818
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:05,800
It was him.

819
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,094
But...

820
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,013
So I naturally assumed
it was your boyfriend.

821
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,142
I got angry at you for boasting
about your boyfriend in my dream.

822
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,602
You can ask Namsuri.

823
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:20,606
Yeom-mi, hurry up and get to the point.
I need to go see if the rice is ready.

824
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,858
You said, "But."

825
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,278
-"But"?
-Yes.

826
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:29,365
You said, "But."
That means there's something unexpected.

827
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,804
<i>That "But" kept bothering me.</i>

828
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,724
<i>But I really couldn't hear anything</i>
<i>after that. It was so frustrating.</i>

829
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:57,476
-Is it like <i>The Usual Suspects?</i>
-It's more shocking than that.

830
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,103
Anyway...

831
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,941
A moment ago,
I was finally able to hear that part.

832
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:07,069
Okay, congratulations. So what did I say?

833
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,780
You said something shocking.

834
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,658
"He's the one who saved me.

835
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,659
But..."

836
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,786
He's the one who saved me.

837
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:17,955
It was him.

838
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:22,001
-But...
-<i>But that person who saved you...</i>

839
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,128
...the person who saved me.

840
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,757
is going to be the Grim Reaper
who takes away my soul.

841
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,343
-What?
-You said the person who saved you

842
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,637
is going to be the Grim Reaper
who takes away your soul.

843
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,263
It means you're going to die.

844
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,558
What?

845
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,518
<i>Ms. Descendant is going to die?</i>

846
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,686
No.

847
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,396
<i>This will be our last session.</i>

848
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,398
Why does this have to happen to me?

849
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,358
<i>I know that you've decided</i>
<i>to use the power you need</i>

850
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,567
<i>on her instead.</i>

851
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,528
<i>She said it's gods' duty</i>
<i>to protect humans.</i>

852
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:33,906
<i>-If you fail to ascend the throne...</i>
<i>-What will happen if I die?</i>

853
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,824
<i>Stop talking nonsense.</i>

854
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,494
<i>How can I call myself a king</i>
<i>if I can't even protect that woman?</i>

855
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,454
<i>How is anything more important</i>
<i>than your life?</i>

856
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,540
<i>-You're going to die?</i>
<i>-I told you that I'll protect you.</i>

857
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,167
<i>You're going to disappear from my memory?</i>

858
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,585
<i>I love you.</i>
