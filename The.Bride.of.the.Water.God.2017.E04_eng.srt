1
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,900
What are you?

2
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,444
I told you.

3
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,195
I'm a god.

4
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,663
Lord Habaek.

5
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,374
Your abilities...

6
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,876
Your power...

7
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,462
It's finally back!

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,361
How could this happen?

9
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,988
How did you...

10
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,032
How did you regain your power?

11
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,619
Please try it again.

12
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,870
Goodness.

13
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,788
Please try it.

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,679
How can it be gone again?

15
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,892
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

16
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,691
It's your fault.

17
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,610
It's all your fault!

18
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,986
Because of you,

19
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,615
do you know how I've lived?

20
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,118
It's so unfair.

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,455
No!

22
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,915
Die.

23
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,627
Die!

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,046
Die!

25
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,013
<i>Please save me!</i>

26
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,372
I told you.

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,291
I'm a god.

28
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,470
I'm still dreaming.

29
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,856
I'm still dreaming.

30
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,160
This dream is long.

31
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,713
I've seen humans do this
to see if they're dreaming.

32
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,964
I'm still in a dream.

33
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,883
No, you're not.

34
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,886
-I am.
-No, you aren't.

35
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,387
How can his power...

36
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,097
How can his power...

37
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,643
How can his power...

38
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,229
How can his power...

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
I can't believe this.

40
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,360
It's impossible.

41
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,364
It's impossible.

42
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,160
What do we do?

43
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,703
Impossible.

44
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,039
I must be dreaming.

45
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,214
It's impossible.

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,884
Right. It must be my feelings of guilt.

47
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,348
My condition must be worse than I thought.

48
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,142
In addition to hearing things,
I'm seeing things too.

49
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,478
It's okay.

50
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,691
I'll take some medicine.
It's just my feelings of guilt.

51
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,067
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

52
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,027
<i>It's all your fault!</i>

53
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,779
<i>Because of you...</i>

54
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,320
Oh, my gosh. Let go of me!

55
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,530
-Don't!
-Relax.

56
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,077
You run away every time.

57
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,870
Thank you.

58
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,463
Who was he?

59
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,050
-I don't know.
-Think carefully.

60
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,470
Does anyone hold a grudge against you?

61
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,222
This is a problem.
You can't even report it.

62
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,640
I should...

63
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,642
report it.

64
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,686
Someone was trying to kill you,

65
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,730
and the king of the Land of Water
saved you.

66
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,982
You can't say that to anyone.

67
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,233
Who would believe that?

68
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,739
How could he throw you from that high up?

69
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,033
He's so evil.

70
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,005
Is this the house
you were making such a fuss about?

71
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,092
I didn't make a fuss.

72
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,178
Go in.

73
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:34,972
Thank you.

74
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,068
Are you...

75
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,778
really a god,

76
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,656
not a monster or a ghost?

77
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,575
-Are you really a deity?
-My goodness.

78
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,078
You're so different from the God I know.

79
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,299
Let's go.

80
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,390
What are you doing?

81
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:25,273
The holy foot of Lord Habaek
has crossed your threshold.

82
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,608
-Sorry?
-The god is inside your gate now.

83
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,569
You have to let him in.

84
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,738
I have to...

85
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,325
Hey. Wait.

86
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,703
Wait.

87
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,541
Do you believe
Lord Habaek is the God of Water?

88
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,127
Answer me. Do you believe it?

89
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,421
Do you believe it?

90
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,172
I do.

91
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,925
Yet you want him to leave your house?

92
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,510
I don't want to go in either.

93
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,388
Let's say the god
gives up on this house out of anger.

94
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,848
I've given up a long time ago.

95
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,434
That means your family
will start to attract

96
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,311
all the kinds of bad luck in the world

97
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,937
and all good luck
will stay out of your house.

98
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,398
All your descendants will die
before they turn 20.

99
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,860
In other words, you'll be punished
for not having faith.

100
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,819
Sorry?

101
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,614
If you were not sure,

102
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,994
you should not have
let the god go through your gate.

103
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,331
I didn't let him in.

104
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,003
I mean...

105
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,436
I live here.

106
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,189
I can't believe this.

107
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,953
You ungrateful woman.

108
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,457
How dare you make me stay here?

109
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,506
Where is she?

110
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,099
It was hard to get in here.

111
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,434
If I had known how this place looked,
I wouldn't have come in.

112
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,602
You don't understand.

113
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,107
Having a roof over your head...
makes a huge difference.

114
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,417
Please don't worry too much.

115
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,086
The owner of the duck boat tour company
is fond of me.

116
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,256
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure you will be comfortable.

117
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,313
<i>The world of mankind</i>
<i>is actually a pretty fun place.</i>

118
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,733
<i>You should have some fun.</i>

119
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,401
That sleazy old man.

120
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,113
That blabbermouth brought me bad luck.

121
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,920
No way. This is crazy.

122
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,756
This can't be.

123
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,183
HABAEK

124
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
SONG IL-GOOK

125
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,561
HAE MO-SU, LADY YUHWA

126
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,354
JUN KWANG-RYUL, JUMONG,
GOGURYEO, OH YEON-SOO

127
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,108
GOD OF WATER

128
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,990
That's impossible.

129
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,868
This can't be.

130
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,586
<i>I'm in Gyeryongsan to practice meditation.</i>

131
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,129
<i>Don't contact me.</i>

132
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,765
Have a good day.

133
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,436
-Bye.
-Have a good day.

134
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:21,986
That's right!

135
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,447
<i>Don't they have the power</i>
<i>to make anything happen?</i>

136
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,367
Can you make that become mine?

137
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,452
If you faithfully carry out
your duties as my servant,

138
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,621
I can certainly make that thing for you.

139
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,374
That too?

140
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,752
Yes. All I need to do is snap my fingers.

141
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,255
That's the point.

142
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,841
Why does he keep leeching off of me?

143
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,431
Look.

144
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,226
I want to become richer
than Sheikh Mansour.

145
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,061
-Make me some gold now.
-Right now, I can't.

146
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,813
I told you
that I'm in a bit of a situation.

147
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:00,900
A situation?

148
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,776
What can it be?

149
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,320
He's in a bit of a bind.

150
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,156
You must think it's weird
he's like that when he's a god.

151
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,074
-Yes.
-There's a reason.

152
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,409
It's because...

153
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,787
You don't need to tell me. I hate
listening to others' hard-luck stories.

154
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,955
Oh, okay.

155
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,755
Do you have any leftover rice?

156
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,342
He's here to find the sacred stones?

157
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,095
Yes. He just has to get them
from the three gods here,

158
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,181
and we were told it wouldn't be hard.

159
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,182
But...

160
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,684
I have no idea why it got so messed up.

161
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,948
<i>He's never been through an ordeal</i>
<i>like this in the last 2,800 years.</i>

162
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,283
<i>He must be extremely distressed now.</i>

163
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,577
<i>He hasn't even been able to take</i>
<i>warm baths, which he loves.</i>

164
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,330
What?

165
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,791
He's 2,800 years old?

166
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,459
Are you sure you don't want to know more?

167
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,338
Yes. I really hate having to listen
to others' hard-luck stories.

168
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,469
-Then why do you have that job?
-Sorry?

169
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,305
As a doctor, you have to listen to
people's stories all the time.

170
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,897
He lost his power?

171
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,567
Goodness. Then he's nothing.

172
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,702
My gosh, what's he doing?

173
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,127
What on earth are you doing now?

174
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,338
Gosh, you can't be doing that here.

175
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,090
-Come out right now!
-Be quiet.

176
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,591
I said come out right now!

177
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,766
No. Don't. Don't get up. Just stay there.

178
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,726
What do you want?

179
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,020
Please. Just stay in there.

180
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,566
Here.

181
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,570
-I wanted to take a warm bath.
-Warm bath?

182
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,697
<i>He hasn't even been able to take</i>
<i>warm baths, which he loves.</i>

183
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,948
I don't need it.

184
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,202
Yes, you do.

185
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,039
People will see it
and report you to the police.

186
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,416
The police will come to get you.
You know what "police" is, right?

187
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,466
People will report me to the police
for taking a bath? How mean.

188
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,718
That's not why people
would call the police.

189
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,220
No? Then what's the reason?

190
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,057
Indecent exposure.
It's an offense against public--

191
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,227
Can you pull up the towel?

192
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,648
Pull it up, please.

193
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,859
Are you going to keep ordering me around?

194
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,570
Have you forgotten that I'm a god
and that I'm your master?

195
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,573
I don't know about that,
but I heard you lost your power.

196
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,910
Can a god still be called a god
without his power?

197
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,295
I'm getting a bad feeling.

198
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,726
That's right.

199
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,688
My power has been on and off,
but I'll regain it soon.

200
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,023
And...

201
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,777
I guess you haven't heard this.

202
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,988
Does losing my power mean I'm not a god?

203
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,867
Will you no longer be human
if you lose your human nature?

204
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,370
Do you still not know

205
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,164
why those flowers kept talking to you
and drove you crazy?

206
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,542
I'll help you remember it.

207
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,343
Don't you dare...

208
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,555
test me.

209
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,521
You stopped hearing them talking
because you helped me.

210
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,189
If you betray me,
it'll start happening again.

211
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,692
-Is that a threat?
-"A threat"?

212
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,195
Blame your foolish ancestors
who made such a promise with the gods.

213
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,073
I don't want to stay here for a long time.

214
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,410
I don't even expect you to help me
resolve my situation.

215
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,414
Just make sure that my stay here
isn't uncomfortable by serving me well.

216
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,751
If you still can't accept it,

217
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,921
repay me for everything I've done.
I helped you

218
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,089
and saved your life.

219
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:47,019
Fine. Repaying you makes more sense
than living as your servant.

220
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,189
But don't forget
that this is the human world.

221
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,441
It's 2017, and you're in Seoul, Korea.

222
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,945
If you want to live here,
don't take baths wherever you want.

223
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,865
And humans aren't objects.

224
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,159
You can't own people.

225
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,911
Servant? Master?

226
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,662
Not a chance.

227
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,414
One more thing!

228
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,043
If you kiss me again...

229
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,670
-That is my right.
-...I'll report you to the police.

230
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,976
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH
DOCTOR YUN SO-A

231
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,152
-Are you okay?
<i>-Who are you?</i>

232
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,696
I'm his guardian.

233
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,032
Who are you, really?

234
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,617
Hye-ra.

235
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,038
It's been a while, Mr. Shin.

236
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,291
I'm sorry about yesterday.
It was our mistake.

237
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,168
You don't need to apologize
for my crazy fan causing a scene.

238
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,629
BLESSED MENTAL HEALTH
DOCTOR YUN SO-A

239
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,716
I think she was just trying her best
to treat her patient.

240
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,384
Do you know her?

241
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,468
She's a good doctor.

242
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,055
I'm not so sure about that.
I just know that she is rude.

243
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,143
Have you ever worked with
an actor who is always sorry?

244
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,478
-Is there an actor like that?
-Ji Sung.

245
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,317
Excuse me.

246
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,781
Was it not funny?

247
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,540
Here is the list of the owners
of the site for Block World.

248
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:19,963
By the way, Chairman Shin seems to want
to get involved with the bidding too.

249
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,924
Don't worry, and focus on
dealing with the landowners.

250
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,677
Yes, sir.
I'll get in touch with them today.

251
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,850
Would you like
a meeting with Chairman Shin?

252
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,310
Yes.

253
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,440
By the way, do you know
what handsome scissors are called?

254
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,734
-Sorry?
-Handsome guy.

255
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,319
Mr. Shin.

256
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,865
In my favorite comedy show's new segment,
they make these kind of jokes.

257
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,241
It's so funny.

258
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,453
You don't watch much television.
Why do you like comedy shows?

259
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,080
Do you want to know a secret?

260
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,375
To be honest, I don't find it funny.
I don't understand why people laugh.

261
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,046
What I'm most jealous about
is humans' sense of humor.

262
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,256
No matter how hard I try,
I just don't get it.

263
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,468
LIST OF LANDOWNERS, YUN SO-A

264
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,764
I keep running into this girl,

265
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,432
Yun So-a.

266
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,018
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

267
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,854
<i>Do you know</i> <i>how I've lived?</i>

268
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,564
<i>It's so unfair.</i>

269
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,691
Think carefully.

270
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,902
Does anyone hold a grudge against you?

271
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,613
I think I should make a report.

272
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,827
Someone was trying to kill you,

273
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,954
and the king of the Land of Water
saved you.

274
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,497
You can't say that to anyone.

275
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,457
He's right.

276
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,419
But still...

277
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,842
It's driving me crazy. What should I do?

278
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,766
Why do you come to work
at different times every day?

279
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,562
A patient had to go back. She seemed
to suffer from paranoia and neurosis.

280
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,355
She would've stayed
for at least two years.

281
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,273
Hey,

282
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,191
I almost died yesterday.

283
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,943
-What?
-I visited Yeom-mi.

284
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,113
A man dragged me to the rooftop
and pushed me off.

285
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,116
As I was falling, I thought I'd die.

286
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,661
Suddenly, the king of the Land of Water
appeared and saved me.

287
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,329
He wasn't handsome.

288
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,545
What is with you these days?
Do you want to become a different person?

289
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,048
Among our patients,

290
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,217
is there anyone who hates me?

291
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,344
There is. Mr. Ma Bong-yeol. You know that.

292
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,014
-Do you want me to read it out?
-Hey.

293
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,060
Could anyone...

294
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,564
hold a grudge against me?

295
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,067
Is there anyone who might want to kill me?

296
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,612
There are many of those.
Didn't you know that?

297
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,739
What?

298
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,241
Hyeong-sik, Min-cheol, Hye-jeong,

299
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,536
Hyeon-a, Seo-won, Seong-bae,
and some others.

300
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,914
I can't even count them all
on my fingers.

301
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,750
Who are they?

302
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,752
You don't know? My friends.

303
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,213
How would I know who your friends are?

304
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,173
Also, why would they hate me?

305
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,217
You don't remember?

306
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,095
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

307
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,724
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

308
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,242
A beggar's birthday cake
doesn't taste good.

309
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,880
Take it off. It's my jacket.

310
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,759
Take it off.

311
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,897
Don't cry.

312
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,984
Thank you.

313
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,819
Sang-yu, move.

314
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,822
Move.

315
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,214
<i>You were very little,</i>
<i>but you were so mean.</i>

316
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,134
We used to say

317
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,803
we would kill you when we grew up.

318
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,348
We were just kids then.

319
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,434
We still talk about those days
when we get together.

320
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,147
You're making me feel nostalgic.

321
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,196
<i>I had a birthday cake today</i>
<i>instead of yesterday.</i>

322
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,659
<i>Dad gave me the best part,</i>
<i>the cherry and the chocolate.</i>

323
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,785
MY BIRTHDAY

324
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,458
I can't believe you.

325
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,543
Why did you take it away from me?

326
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,879
It's not too small for me.

327
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,715
Even if it becomes small for me
or gets holes, it'll still be mine.

328
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:29,064
I told him I wanted sausages
so many times.

329
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,652
And he gives me only kimchi.

330
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,701
I did nothing wrong.

331
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,038
I'm the victim.

332
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,714
<i>She left keys for us.</i>

333
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,925
<i>She said we could eat anything</i>
<i>in the fridge.</i>

334
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,638
This is something called a fridge.

335
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,515
I feel sorry for Ms. Descendant.

336
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,942
Are these clothes?

337
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,819
That was all I could find
in the recycling bin.

338
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,488
I can't go like this.

339
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,782
Then let's go tomorrow.
I have to work today too.

340
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,866
Call a taxi.

341
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,635
You can eat alone. I'm fine.

342
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,722
It's important to have three meals a day.
You don't know that?

343
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,306
I don't want to go out today.

344
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,516
Why not?

345
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,561
Did you take private loans?
Are your creditors here?

346
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,230
-You've been acting strange.
-That's not it.

347
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,899
You should never take private loans.

348
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,361
-How much did you borrow?
-Fine, I'll go.

349
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,904
I'll eat.

350
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,782
You can't take private loans.

351
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,119
-I'll come after locking the door.
-Okay.

352
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,872
Gosh.

353
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,667
I'd be much happier without him.

354
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,853
Gosh!

355
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,606
What's wrong?

356
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,030
Nothing. I'm sorry.

357
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,783
I was going to ask for directions,
and you treat me like a pervert.

358
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,868
What the hell?

359
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,336
I'll probably die young.

360
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,385
What's that?

361
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,306
What is going on?

362
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,646
Woman.

363
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,898
Servant!

364
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,452
Hello.

365
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,497
What is going on? How did you...

366
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,875
-You probably took a taxi.
-I need clothes.

367
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,545
If I show up like this,
Mura would feel humiliated.

368
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,256
-Why are you asking me?
-Who is that?

369
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,551
Who...

370
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,511
Oh, you look familiar.

371
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,098
Hurry.

372
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:51,933
Wait.

373
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,893
Take your hands off him.

374
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,855
Take your hands off.
Who do you think you're stopping?

375
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,482
-Take your hands off first.
-I can't believe you.

376
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,943
-Let go.
-What?

377
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,861
-Let go.
-Stop it!

378
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,069
My gosh, you have a good eye.

379
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,113
You wouldn't expect it
from suits hung here,

380
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,949
but this one is made with Italian fabric.

381
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,242
Doesn't it look so sleek?

382
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,410
How much is it?

383
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,411
150,000 won.

384
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,331
This would go for a million won
at department stores.

385
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,250
It's just because this is a no-name shop.
Isn't it extremely unfair?

386
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,086
-Can you give me a discount?
-I'll give you 5,000 won off.

387
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,172
That's the fun part of shopping
at markets, right?

388
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,134
By the way, isn't this for him?
Why is he standing over there?

389
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,510
Shouldn't he try it on?

390
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,678
He's mad as it's not a designer brand.

391
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,264
Goodness, who cares about brands?

392
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,682
Don't you know that
it's all about the person?

393
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,101
You have such a nice body.

394
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,395
You'll make any clothes look expensive.

395
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:23,358
Why would you want to waste money
when you have such a perfect body?

396
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,363
I can give you another 10,000 won off

397
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,114
if you can take a photo of him
in this suit.

398
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,532
I want to hang the photo here.

399
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,619
-Deal!
-Deal.

400
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,956
Why did you even take me
to the department store?

401
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,457
That was my way of getting back at you.

402
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,168
Having to eat pork belly must be tough
when you're used to rib eye.

403
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,836
-What?
-Aren't you hungry?

404
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,547
We still have time
until Namsuri gets back.

405
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,840
I'm a god.

406
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,802
I don't feel lowly desires like hunger.

407
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,137
I heard the voracious deity kissed you.

408
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,697
You should eat. I bet there's no cure
to treat a god that faints.

409
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,739
Cut it out.

410
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,827
Goodness!

411
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,248
Seriously.

412
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,715
Here, have this.

413
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,427
What do you think you're doing?

414
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,348
I wouldn't be doing this
if Namsuri hadn't asked me so earnestly.

415
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,268
I'm sweating buckets in this heat
to serve you well.

416
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,812
Please try to be considerate
of your servant here,

417
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,690
-although I don't understand this.
-You're too chatty.

418
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,569
About that goddess,
Mura or whatever her name is,

419
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,237
do you think she'll help you this time?

420
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,613
Yes.

421
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,533
It seems like you have
unconditional trust in her.

422
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,076
Yes. With Mura, I do.

423
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
I guess it's possible

424
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,291
to have unconditional trust in someone.

425
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,084
Don't you think it's dumb, though?

426
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,796
Why don't you have someone like that?

427
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,340
-What do you mean?
-Someone whom you can fully trust.

428
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,092
Someone who's always on your side,
no matter what.

429
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,635
You should have at least
one person like that.

430
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,722
If the person whom you trust betrays you,
you'll come to understand

431
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,140
how futile that belief is.

432
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,061
Excuse me, could we have
some warm water here?

433
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,270
Sure

434
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,567
Why do you want to drink warm water
in this heat?

435
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,069
-Is your stomach upset?
-Yes.

436
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,161
-You don't like cold water?
-No.

437
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,829
-Why?
-Because it's cold.

438
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,170
Did you jump in the water
in the middle of winter?

439
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,880
Why did you want to die?

440
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,633
What...

441
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,136
What are you talking about? Goodness!

442
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,472
Why would I want to die?

443
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,018
Was it because of the person
who betrayed you?

444
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,774
-How foolish.
-Look--

445
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,446
-Hello?
-<i>I'm here.</i>

446
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,074
-<i>Where should I go?</i>
-We'll come to you. Okay.

447
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,868
Let's go if you're not going to eat.

448
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,167
Yes, where are you now?

449
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,811
A servant of the God of Water
can't be afraid of water.

450
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,396
It just doesn't make sense.

451
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,693
What doesn't make sense is your...

452
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,032
How about we do a little deal?

453
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,160
If you do me a favor,
I'll do the same for you.

454
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,744
I have no favor to ask you.

455
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,538
Please don't call me your servant.

456
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,124
Your turn.
Anything but buying you a designer suit.

457
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,294
I'll count down from five.
You'll lose your chance after that.

458
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,337
-Five, four, three, two, one.
-I have no favor to ask you,

459
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,424
but I do want to warn you of something.
I'll give you a warning instead.

460
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,176
-"A warning"?
-That's right.

461
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,598
Don't fall for me.

462
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,891
There's no way out

463
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,392
if you fall for me.

464
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,855
<i>You're seriously something.</i>

465
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,523
I've warned you.

466
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,442
Deal.

467
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,568
Deal.

468
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,121
"There's no way out"?

469
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,707
Was that supposed to be a joke?

470
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,626
Was it a parody or satire?

471
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,587
Was he actually being serious?

472
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,422
Unbelievable.

473
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,634
I'll hit the jackpot if I open a clinic
in the divine world.

474
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,052
Shall I emigrate there?

475
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,307
-Hey, what's up?
-<i>Where are you?</i>

476
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,269
I'm in front of the clinic.

477
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,979
I told you not to worry about them.

478
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,856
They're just neighbors.

479
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,734
-If you keep nagging like this--
-The land might get sold.

480
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,652
What?

481
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,948
-Beriwon Resort?
-That windshield guy's company.

482
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,617
I heard that company will build
a resort there.

483
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,578
Do you want to know what's crazy?
A road will be built there too.

484
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,499
It means that they need your land
in order to build their resort.

485
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,627
Then shall I ask them for more money?

486
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,130
No, wait. How about I ask
for five times the market price?

487
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,093
-What is it?
-Hello?

488
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,177
Who is it?

489
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,429
Yes, she's back.

490
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,681
It's the resort.

491
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,937
Hello? Yes, I'm the landowner.

492
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,439
Yes, of course.
I'm interested in selling it.

493
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,150
-<i>Then can we meet with you today?</i>
-Yes, of course.

494
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,069
<i>Hello?</i>

495
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,040
I can make some time
to meet with you today, but...

496
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,001
<i>Great. Shall we meet you at your clinic?</i>

497
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,335
No.

498
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:21,549
Please have your CEO call me.

499
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,178
I have about five minutes
until my next patient arrives.

500
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,557
Well, then. I'll be waiting.

501
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,983
What was that about?

502
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,236
I should enjoy having the upper hand.

503
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,572
That jerk has been mocking me
like there's no tomorrow.

504
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,741
You should work harder to earn money.

505
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,367
Then I'd like you to pay the price.

506
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,913
Wait, that's not what I meant...

507
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,917
That nasty temper of yours
is coming out again.

508
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,420
What do if playing hard to get
makes them give up?

509
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,880
Let's just wait.

510
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,864
Thank you for calling
Blessed Mental Health.

511
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,866
This is Director Yun So-a.

512
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,201
<i>This is Shin Hu-ye.</i>

513
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,163
Lady Mura is truly impressive.

514
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,541
She's found a way to live as a goddess
even in the human realm.

515
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,046
I just wish her personality
was more graceful.

516
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,301
Thank goodness she can't use
her power on humans.

517
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,928
-This is crazy.
-Many could've been harmed.

518
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,472
She doesn't throw fits for no reason.

519
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,810
You had to go through that
because you always coddle her like that.

520
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,312
If she finds out
about you losing your power,

521
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,189
she'll look down on you.

522
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,234
That's why you can't tell her.

523
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,778
Make sure you watch your mouth.

524
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,780
What does that mean?

525
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,117
Lady Mura.

526
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,503
You lost what?

527
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,797
You've lost... your power?

528
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,471
Can you recognize me now?

529
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,140
What ticked you off?

530
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,891
What do you mean you lost your power?

531
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,644
Don't worry. It's just temporary.

532
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,605
It'll come back soon.

533
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,570
It was so hard.

534
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,239
We had no way of finding you
and had nowhere to go.

535
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,991
He knew nothing about this world.

536
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,577
He had no power,
so he lost to the voracious deity.

537
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,079
-Voracious deity?
-You know Jugeollin, right?

538
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,873
He challenged Lord Habaek out of the blue.

539
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,250
He fled our land,
and it turned out he was here.

540
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,878
We found the divine servant,
so we asked for help,

541
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,714
-but it doesn't look good.
-A divine servant?

542
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,550
Then that woman was...

543
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,553
She's shockingly stupid.
I need to move into your place.

544
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,555
Where are Biryeom and Judong?

545
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,183
I'll take your sacred stone first,
so get it ready for me.

546
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,606
Hello, Ms. Yun.

547
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,234
Isn't this place a bit secluded
to talk business?

548
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,528
I had a feeling you didn't want
to discuss business.

549
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,407
Why else would I want to see you?

550
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,159
To discuss the windshield wipers?

551
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,453
To discuss bank loans?

552
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,080
Have a seat.

553
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,211
About my land that you're interested in...

554
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,590
Someone else at my company
is handling that. Why--

555
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,636
Well, I need to negotiate with you.

556
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,638
Negotiate?

557
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,308
I heard you needed my land.

558
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,602
-That's correct.
-I want five times its value.

559
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,561
No negotiations.

560
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,606
<i>No.</i>

561
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,108
-What?
-I can't give you the sacred stone.

562
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,443
And I don't know where
Biryeom and Judong are.

563
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,570
-You can't move in either.
-What?

564
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,822
Did you forget?
The guardians of the sacred stones

565
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,325
decide whether or not
to give away the sacred stones.

566
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,161
Lady Mura. Please calm yourself down.

567
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,205
That goes against the rules.

568
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,957
All the guardians of the sacred stones

569
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,416
had protected them

570
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,460
and gave them to the succeeding king--

571
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,087
How dare you get involved?

572
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,134
How can we have a powerless god
as our king?

573
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,095
Look at you.

574
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,514
If you are qualified to be king,

575
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,517
Biryeom and Judong should be
standing before you.

576
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,395
However, you don't even know
where they are.

577
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,189
No?

578
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,984
Okay, then I won't sell.

579
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,655
Your land is the most critical,
so we had decided

580
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,782
to offer you seven times the value,
unlike the others.

581
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,784
If you'd be upset
at being treated differently,

582
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,036
we will pay five times the value
just like everyone else.

583
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,872
You say you won't negotiate,
so we have no choice.

584
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,669
I'll have him bring the contract,
so you can look it over.

585
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,423
I won't sell.

586
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,515
Goodness, it was supposed to be a joke.

587
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,522
In other words, you aren't qualified
to become the king.

588
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,526
-I'm not qualified?
-That's right.

589
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,116
Let's go.

590
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,758
What must I do for you to give it to me?

591
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,594
-What?
-What must I do for you

592
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,928
to acknowledge I'm qualified?

593
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,847
-For me?
-That's right!

594
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,891
-Don't come any closer.
-Tell me!

595
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,393
Report everyone who posted
negative comments about me online.

596
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,027
Shoot! Seven times.

597
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,238
Seven times.

598
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,452
-What have I done?
-Isn't she the woman that we know?

599
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,037
Ms. Descendant!

600
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,086
That's right. He said he was coming here.

601
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,508
-What are you doing here?
-Well...

602
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,760
I came to see a friend.

603
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,762
A friend? That strange woman
from last time?

604
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,807
Did everything go well?
Are you moving into Hye-ra's place now?

605
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,892
-What are negative comments?
-What?

606
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,314
What you blurted out was to report
people posting negative comments?

607
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,774
<i>I was caught off guard.</i>

608
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,776
I didn't expect that reaction.

609
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,153
You lost it when he asked
what he could do for you.

610
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,823
-That's not it. The sacred stones--
-What else did you ask for?

611
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,283
She wants you to be her bodyguard
at her signing event?

612
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,410
That's right.

613
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,619
What's a bodyguard?

614
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,788
Is she really a goddess?

615
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,290
She acts like a bitter teenage girl.

616
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,626
Ms. Yun.

617
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,635
I see you have company.

618
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,516
Please let me clear up
the misunderstanding

619
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,893
and give me a second chance
to negotiate with you.

620
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,820
If you don't want to,
maybe we can set a time tomorrow--

621
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,572
No.

622
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,074
Bye.

623
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,868
Let's go.

624
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,249
Her friend looks like
he has a lot of gold.

625
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,384
A joke?

626
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:08,682
I don't think we're close enough
to make jokes.

627
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,144
I want to get along with everyone,
regardless of the relationship.

628
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,146
Why?

629
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,816
-What do you mean?
-You can't get along with everyone.

630
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,067
Why not?

631
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,611
If you want to be nice to everyone,

632
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,071
you always have to repress
your own emotions.

633
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,324
Then you will likely find a poor victim

634
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,993
onto whom you will release
those repressed emotions.

635
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,496
In extreme cases, murderers--

636
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,208
I got carried away.

637
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,251
It's fine. It's your job.

638
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,255
I want to be a good person.

639
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,884
I want to help those in need
and give to society.

640
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,179
I want to be someone
who is useful to this world.

641
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,307
Here's another teenager.

642
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,269
-Can I not?
-Not necessarily.

643
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,105
I knew someone like that,

644
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,566
but the ending wasn't that great.

645
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,656
Hello?

646
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,325
<i>You may go see Chairman Shin now.</i>

647
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,451
Okay.

648
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,499
Look over the contract.
It's for seven times the value.

649
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,042
Give me a call once you have.

650
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,048
Grandpa!

651
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,300
I want a talent agency!

652
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,385
Silence!

653
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,304
I'm planning to add a mall in Block World,

654
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,264
so you run that.

655
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,475
You'll make much more
than working as an entertainer.

656
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,396
Darn it.

657
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:41,191
I lost two buildings
trying to make you a doctor.

658
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,486
Why are you wasting your time
after graduating from med school?

659
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,116
What are you wearing?

660
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,451
He put me on a roller coaster
and fed me <i>jajangmyeon.</i>

661
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,413
My stupid agency
didn't even give me a heads-up.

662
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,206
But I smiled and did it.

663
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,457
Why? Because I'm a pro.

664
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,670
That's why I'm asking you
for a talent agency,

665
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,548
so I don't have to put up
with things like this.

666
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,133
Why, that...

667
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,222
Go wash this.

668
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,849
Soak it in water.

669
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,101
Like a wet towel, as it's supposed to be.

670
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,395
No!

671
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,439
Why, that...

672
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,108
Get back here!

673
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,402
Move!

674
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:36,038
Yes. I know it would be good for me
to become a doctor.

675
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,956
But what can I do? I can't.

676
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,166
What can I do? I'm stupid.

677
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:44,171
I know I'll make no money
being a minor celebrity.

678
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,841
But that's what I like.

679
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,015
Darn it.

680
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,361
You make me sick.

681
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,162
-What?
-Wipe your face.

682
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,289
You're a star.

683
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,707
Why do you care?

684
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,554
Hey. I don't need it. Take it back.

685
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,644
That jerk.

686
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,359
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

687
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,820
Seven times. I can't believe it.

688
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,199
Oh, my gosh.

689
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,662
I can pinch harder for you.

690
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,081
I'm going to be busy for a while.

691
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,667
Finally.

692
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,423
An international driver's license.

693
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,093
An immunization report in English, proof
of no criminal record, and what else?

694
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,761
The balance has been taken care of.

695
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,264
It'll cost millions in moving fees alone.

696
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,559
Hey. I'll find you a job
with a great clinic, so don't worry.

697
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,478
I have plenty of offers.

698
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,398
Let's have a drink to celebrate.

699
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,108
I have my side job.

700
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,735
Hey. Skip it.

701
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:44,458
You drink a lukewarm,
non-alcoholic drink like it's alcohol.

702
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,126
I can't risk having any more bad luck.

703
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,337
You saw what happened
with the diamond ring.

704
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,089
Then why did we come to a bar?

705
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,508
Why do you hate Korea so much?

706
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,677
You're the weird one.

707
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,137
Haven't you heard
"Korea is Hell on Earth"?

708
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,015
People in their twenties like you
came up with that phrase.

709
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,016
Everyone wants out.

710
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,976
Still, I like Korea.

711
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,188
-What's the use? Korea hates you.
-What?

712
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,525
-Korea likes other people.
-Who?

713
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,944
I met two people today who know
nothing about how the world works.

714
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:17,157
No. One isn't a person. Anyway,
do you know what they have in common?

715
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,161
They were born with
a silver spoon in their mouths.

716
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,871
Life is a hobby for them.

717
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,707
That's why they could spout on

718
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,085
about giving to society
and helping others.

719
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,419
Doctor.

720
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,797
But you know
Korea loves people like them.

721
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,965
Outwardly, they curse them,
but they like them on the inside.

722
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,510
And people like you are the opposite.

723
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,679
Outwardly, they applaud you,
but they hate you on the inside.

724
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,641
There's a reason no one comes
to our clinic.

725
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,602
I'll be in big trouble
when your dad gets back.

726
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:49,356
He told me I had to take good care of you,
but look at your mental state.

727
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,484
You're killing my buzz.

728
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,988
Hey. Let's go singing.

729
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,034
"I hear Hye-ra is dating six guys at once.

730
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,536
One per day of the week."

731
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,829
"Silicon queen.

732
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,665
She thinks she's a goddess.
She makes me want to barf."

733
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,126
These things are negative comments.

734
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,627
Poor Mura.

735
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,879
She's having a rough time here too.

736
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,215
If we click on this, you can report them.

737
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,927
But you can't read Korean.

738
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,388
So you should study <i>hangul </i>first.

739
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,224
This is G. This is N.

740
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,315
R, ROUND
M, MONEY

741
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,070
-Why isn't she home yet?
<i>-</i>I'm sure she'll be back.

742
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,240
"The old witch tries to act cute."

743
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,366
Report.

744
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,415
-What?
-Keep it down.

745
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,084
-What is that sound?
-This isn't your home.

746
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,587
Human men are drunk and fighting.

747
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,631
All sorts of inexplicable things
happen at night in the human world.

748
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,258
That's nothing.

749
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,595
-Why, you little...
-Go ahead, hit me!

750
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,244
"When I watch her terrible acting, I...

751
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,292
I want to tear off her face."

752
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,878
"Tear off her face."

753
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,338
Report.

754
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,382
"I hope that I run into you...

755
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,387
on the street at night someday."

756
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,807
Okay. Report.

757
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,559
"Last time..."

758
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,994
He's really getting to me.

759
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,514
If you keep this up,
I'll just sing a cappella.

760
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,723
Hey.

761
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,592
What are you doing here?

762
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,429
I was thinking of ways
to get my power back.

763
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,057
Why are you doing that here?

764
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,558
Let's go.

765
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:44,776
Next time, think up there,
where the alley meets the main road.

766
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,447
What is that smell?

767
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,992
I brought some spicy chicken.

768
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,496
Something really good happened
to me today,

769
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,705
so it's my treat.

770
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,873
I don't want it.

771
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,670
Did you eat?

772
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,923
I told you. I don't need things like that.

773
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,009
Food.

774
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,138
Food.

775
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,474
Food.

776
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,226
-Stop it.
-Okay.

777
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,564
I get it now.

778
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,024
You get hungry whenever I mention food.

779
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,192
I do not.

780
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,236
That's what you call "a response."

781
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,823
Admit you've become a god
that can now feel hungry.

782
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,033
It's a huge realization.

783
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,911
Why, that woman...

784
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,541
Food!

785
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,589
This is so funny.

786
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,842
Why are you in such a good mood?

787
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:52,927
I met...

788
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,555
a real god today.

789
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,057
What do you mean?

790
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,144
A real god who can save me
from this land of torment.

791
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,697
Who's deceiving you this time?

792
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,325
Not everyone who's handsome is a god.

793
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,286
What is a god?

794
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,537
What?

795
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:23,333
A superior being that grants humans
their most desperate wishes.

796
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,963
That is a true god.

797
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,632
I...

798
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,926
I am a real god.

799
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:33,843
Sure.

800
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,471
Did you finish reporting the negative...
That's right.

801
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,014
You can't read Korean.

802
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,642
Give me that.

803
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:53,613
YUN SO-A

804
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,242
-You can write?
-You should be honored.

805
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,952
That's the first thing I've ever written.

806
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,663
This is how to write my name.

807
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:13,091
HABAK

808
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,058
Goodness.

809
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:31,526
HABAEK

810
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,969
HABAEK
YUN SO-A

811
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,013
What is this?

812
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,682
-Please eat.
-Forget it.

813
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,730
-I've seen you.
-What?

814
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,653
That day, by the Han River.
After I left, you picked up--

815
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,618
That's what you get for talking
about "your side" and "my side".

816
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,537
You've experienced the pain of betrayal

817
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,913
as well as hunger.

818
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,082
You should've become
a better king yesterday

819
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,376
than the day before,
and today than yesterday.

820
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,502
What was that?

821
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,505
I'm saying you're learning
how to be a king properly.

822
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,385
So? Did you figure out
what a bodyguard is?

823
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,555
Yes. Since I learned how to read...

824
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,349
There's a movie called <i>The Bodyguard.</i>

825
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,726
-He watched it.
-It's pretty cool.

826
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,062
It's worth experiencing at least once.

827
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,069
He underestimates humans.

828
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,118
She's here.

829
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,912
Please clear a path.

830
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,794
-Lord Habaek!
-Let go.

831
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,962
Let go!

832
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,423
-Stop pushing!
-Stop it!

833
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,635
Don't come any closer!

834
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:21,928
Stop it!

835
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,558
No. You can't get hurt.

836
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,604
No.

837
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,816
What's wrong with you people?

838
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,493
Why are they like that?

839
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,078
Why?

840
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:52,875
You think I'm a failure, don't you?

841
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,838
You just touched your nose.

842
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,591
They say when you lie,
your hormones make your nose itch.

843
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,468
That's why you touch it
without realizing it.

844
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,681
No, I scratched my nose because it itched.

845
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,976
You yawned last week and the week before
for the same reason.

846
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,604
It's been two hours already, So-min.

847
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,233
You've been nitpicking everything I do.

848
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,861
-That makes your treatment--
-Forget it.

849
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,947
I'm suddenly in a bad mood!

850
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,999
YUN SO-A

851
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,085
Hold it in. You can do it.

852
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,087
Hold it in.

853
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,012
-Are you going to keep doing this?
-Sorry.

854
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:47,680
I just can't.

855
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,185
I can't trust an heir to the throne
who doesn't have his power.

856
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,146
Lady Mura...

857
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,902
Darn it.

858
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,196
I'm losing my mind here.

859
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,285
-<i>Hello?</i>
-I can't do it anymore.

860
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:10,411
You do it.

861
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,545
You want my what?

862
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,798
I'm stressed out,
so I need to go for a drive.

863
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:22,757
Give me your car keys.

864
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,843
Go home.

865
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,304
<i>I'll pick the lock if you refuse.</i>

866
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,388
What was that?

867
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,848
I'll look online.

868
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,100
I've memorized the workings
of a car already, anyway.

869
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,692
I said I want to drive.

870
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,903
<i>I want to kill him.</i>

871
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,947
Isn't there anything online

872
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,949
about how to kill a god?

873
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,742
Hey. That's blasphemy.

874
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,916
Fine, let's do this.

875
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,753
I'm stressed out today too, so let's go.

876
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,047
-I will drive.
-Buckle up.

877
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,103
<i>You can reimburse me for gas.</i>

878
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,477
You're cutting off my neck.

879
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,854
It's fine as long as I'm in it.

880
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:03,858
Come here.

881
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:27,173
I guess my car wasn't enough.

882
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,966
Your car's engine sounds strange.

883
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,426
The exhaust is loud too.

884
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,678
There's a squeaking sound
coming from under the hood.

885
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,556
You just need to tighten
the wheel bearing.

886
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,391
When did you last have it inspected?

887
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,894
I'm speechless.

888
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:44,190
Can you really learn anything
and do anything

889
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,859
after seeing it or reading it once?

890
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,486
Even without your power?

891
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:51,364
It has nothing to do with my power.
That's what makes me a god.

892
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,535
Mr. Nature, I have a question.

893
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,871
Who's Lady Yuhwa's mom?

894
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,456
I can't find it anywhere.

895
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,585
-Who's Lady Yuhwa?
-Your daughter.

896
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,380
Jumong's mom.
King Yuri's maternal grandmother.

897
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,882
You're King Yuri's maternal grandfather.

898
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,717
So who's your wife?

899
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,053
I've never been married.

900
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,014
There's no use pretending to be single.

901
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:34,907
I had...

902
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,618
a really tough day today.

903
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,290
It would've been nice...

904
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,585
if you had your power.

905
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,588
If you had your power,

906
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:53,592
would you be able to create
an ocean full of reefs for me?

907
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,927
Of course.

908
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,471
A white sand beach...

909
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,266
filled with sunshine too?

910
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,020
I want to go into the ocean.

911
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,814
I can see...

912
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,816
the ocean.

913
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,903
<i>I want to swim.</i>

914
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,866
<i>The water doesn't scare me.</i>

915
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,952
<i>I'm alone, but I'm not lonely.</i>

916
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,504
<i>-What are you doing?</i>
<i>-You can't be alone.</i>

917
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,631
<i>I need to be there for me to use my power.</i>

918
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:33,549
<i>Darn it.</i>

919
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,468
<i>I want to be alone.</i>

920
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,112
<i>What is this now?</i>

921
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,655
<i>You can't swim.</i>

922
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,282
<i>I'm swimming now.</i>

923
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,451
<i>Really? I'll let go then.</i>

924
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,622
<i>No, hold on.</i>

925
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,542
<i>Darn. I'm sure I was able to swim earlier.</i>

926
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,337
<i>Why do I suddenly feel like</i>
<i>I won't be able to?</i>

927
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,382
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

928
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:18,761
<i>I'll keep you safe,</i>
<i>at least when you're in the water.</i>

929
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,126
I'm sorry.

930
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,550
For what?

931
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,626
<i>Did you try to kill me on purpose?</i>

932
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,920
<i>When you start something,</i>
<i>you need to finish it.</i>

933
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,213
How can a god be so selfish?

934
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,549
You won't be able to live
the way you want.

935
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,926
<i>-A divine servant?</i>
<i>-Who cares about that?</i>

936
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,429
<i>No, I can't.</i>

937
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,599
<i>I'm getting excited. It's been a while</i>
<i>since we worked together to get Habaek.</i>

938
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,768
<i>You guys, how can you be</i>
<i>this irresponsible?</i>

939
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,479
<i>Don't tell me you're doing this</i>
<i>because of her.</i>

940
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,316
Thank you for saving my life.

941
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,276
I promise you that I'll protect you.
