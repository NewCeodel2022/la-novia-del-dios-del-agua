1
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,339
1,200 YEARS AGO, SILLA

2
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,552
Father.

3
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,180
Father.

4
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,848
-What's the matter?
-There.

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,395
Father... Father!

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,521
Father!

7
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,149
<i>Lord Biryeom, you are not permitted</i>
<i>to harass humans.</i>

8
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,195
<i>Divine servants are an exception.</i>
<i>Blessings, punishments, glory, and pain:</i>

9
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,654
<i>Gods can give them as they wish.</i>

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,170
Okay. What do you say?
It's really your turn now.

11
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,263
You guys lost the sacred stones,
didn't you?

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,311
Hey!

13
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,866
How did you lose the sacred stones?

14
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,790
-What are you talking about?
-He lost them.

15
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,166
It's not my fault.

16
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,671
Mura, why are you giving in so quickly?

17
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,298
He lost them. It was his idea
to use each other as an excuse.

18
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,806
Did you really lose the sacred stones?

19
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,433
Is that why you couldn't give them to us?

20
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,686
I wanted to tell you the truth.

21
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,813
But Biryeom wanted to hold out.

22
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,023
He said you wouldn't forgive us.

23
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,822
Ms. Descendant.

24
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,894
What is she doing? Is she taking my car?

25
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,272
Gosh, So-a!

26
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,540
Did you really lose the sacred stones?

27
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,960
Yes.

28
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,296
Let me explain.

29
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,213
Let's go.

30
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,299
Let's talk tomorrow.

31
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,885
I can explain now.

32
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,762
I don't want to wait until tomorrow.

33
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,932
-Give me the keys.
-I can drive faster.

34
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,354
Let's get it over with.

35
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,565
Just find out who is responsible
for what right now.

36
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,482
Biryeom.

37
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,404
This is real.

38
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,947
Getting hit by a human is nothing.

39
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,574
Hey, are you crazy?

40
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,327
I surrender.

41
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,581
You're crazy.

42
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,338
Why did you use violence?
What were you thinking?

43
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,089
You don't have your power.

44
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,341
What if he threw you?

45
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,103
Are you okay?

46
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,689
His punch is still strong.

47
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,581
<i>The phone is turned off.</i>

48
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,000
-Yeom-mi.
-<i>Please leave a message.</i>

49
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,543
<i>There will be charges after the beep.</i>

50
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,178
Sang-yu's phone number was...

51
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,181
What was it?

52
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,228
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

53
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,779
Ahn Bin, that jerk.

54
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,254
How did Habaek find out?

55
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,964
I thought you had told him.

56
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,850
I think I know.

57
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,896
Something like this happened
2,000 years ago too.

58
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,566
-Habaek found out then too.
-Wait.

59
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:26,821
We took one of Habaek's fireflies each
and lost them.

60
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,366
Give it back to me.

61
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,326
Why just me?

62
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,704
Get Biryeom's first.

63
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,290
Give it back to me.

64
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,709
Mura didn't give you hers.
Why should I give you mine?

65
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,794
Get Mura's first.

66
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,216
-Give it to me.
-Get Biryeom's first.

67
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,762
When he found out we had lost them,
he punched me and almost turned you...

68
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,139
into a carp.

69
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,057
And you used the exact same method?

70
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,392
Are you stupid?

71
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,021
Yes, I am.

72
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,147
You didn't know?

73
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,398
Fine.

74
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,900
If you're stupid,

75
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,779
why don't you just worry about
the Land of the Sky?

76
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,864
The divine servant?

77
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,908
Who cares about that?

78
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,496
A god in the Land of the Sky
brought confusion to the world of deities.

79
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,041
As a fellow god,
shouldn't I try to rescue the situation?

80
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,083
Rescue the situation?

81
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,669
You deliberately made Queen Mother angry

82
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,755
so that she made a divine servant.

83
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,550
You just wanted to give Habaek
a hard time for fun.

84
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,554
You're right. I was disappointed
when Habaek didn't fall for my trick.

85
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,765
Habaek...

86
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,267
didn't do anything then.

87
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,686
Why would he?

88
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,940
Why does he want to talk tomorrow?

89
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,067
He must have something
more important to take care of.

90
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,697
What?

91
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,075
She's not coming.

92
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,744
We shouldn't have let her go alone
like that.

93
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,541
I'm sure she was really shocked.

94
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,846
<i>I'm here.</i>

95
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,518
HAESARI

96
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,734
How have you been?

97
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,948
I'm sure you've been well.

98
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,450
You wouldn't have a thing
to worry about up there.

99
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,006
Mom, I'm sorry...

100
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,926
I don't come here often.

101
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,261
THE LATE KANG YU-SEON

102
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,055
YOU WILL BE MISSED.
REST IN PEACE IN A PLACE WITHOUT PAIN.

103
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,189
Mom...

104
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,026
have you ever heard about

105
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,195
our ancestors being divine servants?

106
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,824
What did our ancestors do?

107
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,744
Are they on your side or Dad's side?

108
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,997
One of you fooled the other.

109
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,712
Mom...

110
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,131
these days,

111
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,885
so many weird things are happening to me.

112
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,931
I have no one to talk to
about those things.

113
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,228
Yeom-mi and Sang-yu are all I have.

114
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,356
You remember Sang-yu, right?

115
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,901
Among the kids who stayed with our family,

116
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,778
he was the most timid one.

117
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,071
Yes.

118
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,865
He's still lingering around me.

119
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,076
He's so annoying. He nags too much.

120
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,833
Mom, do you know his phone number,
by any chance?

121
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,465
What about the phone number of my office?

122
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,773
I still...

123
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,984
haven't heard anything from Dad.

124
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,990
Everyone says that he's gone missing,

125
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,995
but both you and I know that
he's not coming back by choice.

126
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,915
It makes me speechless.

127
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,507
It's not that I miss him.

128
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,386
I just need closure.

129
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,014
Don't you think he should
at least come back to explain

130
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,808
why he had to do it
so that I can understand?

131
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,060
He can leave again after that
if he wants to.

132
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,255
Mom,
you're not actually going to show up...

133
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,008
like those scenes...

134
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,178
in scary movies, are you?

135
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,473
You don't have to show up.

136
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,974
I'll be off.

137
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,526
Bye, Mom.

138
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,404
I'll visit you again soon.

139
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,548
Are you all right?

140
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,016
What did you just ask?

141
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,446
What sin did my ancestors commit?

142
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,615
What kinds of deadly sins did they commit

143
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,409
to make you guys think of my life
and fate as your playthings?

144
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,956
Let me tell you something. That's right.

145
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,251
Living is neither joyful
nor meaningful to me.

146
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,629
I've had no time to think
about such things.

147
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,882
A future? A dream?

148
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,179
Sure, I guess I used to have those things
at a certain point in my life.

149
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,890
I'm currently paying for having a dream

150
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,934
that I couldn't handle,

151
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,977
and it has exhausted me.

152
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,815
Nevertheless, that doesn't mean
I don't care about how I die.

153
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,028
You said you're a god.

154
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,155
Then grant me a wish.

155
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,116
Let me meet my dad.

156
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,828
I want to ask him why he had to dump
all of these burdens on me

157
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,041
and if he's been able to sleep at night
and eat well since leaving me like that.

158
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,542
I want to tell him to take them all
from me.

159
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,544
He couldn't even save his own daughter.

160
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,381
How is he going to save the world?
If I could ask him that question,

161
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,717
I'd have nothing more to wish for.

162
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,973
That's why I can't die.

163
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,143
I can't die until I meet my dad again...

164
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,354
and tell him all of these things.

165
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,491
I promise you.

166
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,870
I'll make sure that your life...

167
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,833
will never be put in danger again
because of what we do...

168
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,921
and that I'll protect you.

169
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,925
That's a god's duty.

170
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,685
I want to be cool and say
that I'll protect myself,

171
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,191
but to be completely honest,

172
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,528
you guys are too much for me to handle.

173
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,284
All right, promise me.

174
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,911
And please be sure to keep your word.

175
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,788
I will.

176
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,041
It's a god's promise.

177
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,588
Deal.

178
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,217
Deal.

179
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,647
Pinky swear.

180
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,984
I promise.

181
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,032
Now it's official.

182
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,146
<i>What sin did my ancestors commit?</i>

183
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>What kind of deadly sins did they commit</i>

184
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,945
<i>to make you guys think of my life</i>
<i>and fate as your playthings?</i>

185
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,866
<i>Please don't kill us.</i>
<i>If you spare us our lives,</i>

186
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,869
we'll dedicate the rest of our lives
to faithfully serving all gods.

187
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,496
1,200 YEARS AGO

188
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,331
That's not enough.

189
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,210
Your family and descendants

190
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,130
will have to devote themselves
to the deities for generations.

191
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,175
Only one child will be allowed
for each generation.

192
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,219
After the child is born,

193
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,763
the spouse of your descendant
will leave without any exception.

194
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,975
Experiencing the bliss
of a short-lived love

195
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,893
followed by the long-lived pain
of betrayal

196
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,146
will be the punishment
for deceiving the gods.

197
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,773
Also, all children in your family

198
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,859
will exist solely for the gods.

199
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,903
<i>That will be the punishment</i>
<i>for betraying the deities.</i>

200
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,446
<i>Do you promise?</i>

201
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,535
I honestly can't get used to this.

202
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,370
Ms. Descendant.

203
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,677
I should put up a partition wall soon.

204
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,055
What's up?

205
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,891
Well...

206
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,645
where should I go to meet that goddess?

207
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,564
-I want to give back her car.
-Why would you give her my car?

208
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,983
-Sorry?
-I told her that I'd keep it.

209
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,819
I told her to transfer the ownership.

210
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,241
What are you talking about?
You don't even have a driver's license.

211
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,951
That's the excuse she gave too.

212
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,786
Hence, I told her
to put it under your name.

213
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,413
-What did you just say?
-It's only yours on paper.

214
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,748
That car is mine.

215
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,668
Not a chance.
You don't even have a license.

216
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,669
I'm a god.

217
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,171
-I'm not governed by humans' law.
-Cut it out.

218
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,631
I'm going to work.

219
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,389
Whatever.

220
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,018
I feel like I did all that work
for nothing.

221
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,440
I didn't notice it yesterday,
but this car drives so smoothly.

222
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,988
Look at this leather.
My gosh, it feels so luxurious.

223
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,907
I've never driven a car like this before.

224
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,993
I should just sell it.

225
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,958
<i>What are you doing these days?</i>

226
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,796
Why do people think Mr. Shin pays you?

227
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,049
Gosh, I'm confused! Grandpa,
I'll call you back after parking my car.

228
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,386
I can't stand it anymore.

229
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,555
What did Mr. Bang tell him?

230
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,182
Luckily, people found out
you two are related.

231
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,018
Think of what might have happened.

232
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,437
Who says we're related?

233
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,063
Why is his last name Shin?

234
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,815
He used to have nothing.

235
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,900
Does his last name
make him part of the family?

236
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,028
<i>That's absurd.</i>

237
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,696
Aren't you going to fire him?

238
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,240
Cut it out.

239
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,993
You better behave yourself
before I shave all your hair off

240
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,494
and send you to a temple.

241
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,332
My goodness!

242
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,586
How is it going
with the land in Gangwon Province?

243
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,921
No one is pulling anything sneaky, right?

244
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,967
Yes, everything is going fine.

245
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,970
No one has wanted to buy that land,

246
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:31,141
so the landowners are willing
to sign the contract, but...

247
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,019
But?

248
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,939
One of the landowners
is putting off signing the contract

249
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,233
-for personal reasons.
-What?

250
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,070
He's not playing around with us, is he?

251
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,949
Mr. Kim, I just arrived.

252
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,119
You need a garden, a suite,

253
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,080
and a restaurant, right?

254
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,459
Sorry? An interview with Mr. Shin too?

255
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,130
Of course. Don't worry.

256
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,633
You could have told me earlier.

257
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,886
We should help each other.

258
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,597
I'll call you again. Bye.

259
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,265
If there was no reorganization...

260
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,899
What a jerk!

261
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,984
Who is it?

262
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,572
Hey!

263
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,120
-I'm Mr. Min.
-Why do you drive like that?

264
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,955
You were blocking the way.

265
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,957
I had to dodge you.

266
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,584
You should have stopped and honked.

267
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,755
That crossed my mind,
but if I honked, you'd get angry at me.

268
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,673
That's why I didn't.

269
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,007
-Hey.
-Mr. Min.

270
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,178
Also, if you're here to meet Mr. Shin,
you're wasting your time.

271
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,596
He's away right now.

272
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,807
He doesn't want to be interviewed.

273
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,685
We can provide locations
for the shoot, though. Bye.

274
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,861
Please return the handkerchief
as soon as possible.

275
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,573
You shouldn't keep
someone else's stuff too long.

276
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,710
What is with him?

277
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,547
<i>With the leopard at Changgyeonggung</i>
<i>dying in 1973,</i>

278
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,258
<i>Korean leopards became extinct.</i>

279
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,470
<i>Around Gangwon Province,</i>
<i>Korean leopards...</i>

280
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,721
Doctor.

281
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,473
Find a used-car dealer.

282
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,308
What happened?

283
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,893
Why are you raising your voice?

284
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,061
You left saying
you were meeting Mr. Shin yesterday.

285
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,062
What?

286
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,192
You didn't show up
and didn't say anything.

287
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,526
Your phone was turned off.

288
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,612
You didn't come home, either.

289
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,322
I've been watching the news since morning

290
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,741
to see if there were any accidents.

291
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,034
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,162
I thought something had happened.

293
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,623
How will I face your father?

294
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,626
If you keep doing this, I'll move back
to your neighborhood.

295
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,003
Cut it out and mind your own business.

296
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,883
Mr. Shin called a hundred times
and came here a hundred times.

297
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,768
<i>Ms. Yun.</i>

298
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,978
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,523
-Yesterday...
-Doctor.

300
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,816
Mr. Shin...

301
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,237
is here.

302
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,789
What brings you here?

303
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,794
I didn't know what was going on
or what I should do,

304
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,212
so I kept coming here.

305
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,258
I'm sorry.

306
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,927
Something came up.

307
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,221
I should have called you.

308
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,808
My phone broke, and I couldn't remember
your phone number.

309
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,268
I was so far away,

310
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,978
-and I came back too late--
-That's enough.

311
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,647
As long as you're fine, it's okay.

312
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,816
That's all that matters.

313
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,284
I'm sorry.

314
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,828
If you wait here, I'll get the contract...

315
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,421
Ms. Yun.

316
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,509
Ms. Yun.

317
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,929
-Well--
-I understand.

318
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,890
Call me when it's ready.

319
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,767
See you.

320
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,104
Let's meet this evening.

321
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,149
Where will you be? I'll come to you.

322
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,952
Tonight, I'll be somewhere very private.

323
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,206
Oh, I see.

324
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,169
I'll get in touch with you soon.

325
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,172
-I'm sorry.
-All right.

326
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,646
Ahn Bin, that jerk!

327
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,485
I have to see him again?

328
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,550
Sorry.

329
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,596
-Go ahead.
-Well...

330
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,516
I didn't do anything wrong.
It's all Biryeom's fault.

331
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,600
Mura.

332
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,769
Well...

333
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,022
we met up once.

334
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,735
And that jerk kept getting on my nerves.

335
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,279
I just let it slide at first,
but that jerk--

336
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,907
I'm a god too. Will you be more polite?

337
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,325
Be quiet.

338
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,207
Mura threw a water bomb at me first.

339
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,751
13 YEARS EARLIER

340
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,102
Hey, let's talk it over.

341
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,817
<i>She was dashing towards me like a leopard.</i>

342
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,444
<i>I had to protect myself.</i>

343
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,655
Protect yourself?

344
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,949
He shot lightning at me.

345
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,118
Judong flung himself at us to stop us,

346
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,872
and while we were wrestling,
the sacred stones popped out.

347
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,889
<i>We found two of them right away,</i>

348
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,768
<i>but Mura's ended up far away,</i>
<i>and Judong went to get it.</i>

349
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,312
-But he never came back.
-What?

350
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,647
He never came back
no matter how long we waited.

351
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,858
We haven't seen him since then.

352
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,444
We've lost touch completely.

353
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,196
What are you talking about?

354
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,781
We've looked everywhere.

355
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:47,368
But then Biryeom suddenly said
he likes archaeology and left for Rome.

356
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,454
I was going to look for him again
when I got back.

357
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,998
I didn't know the red tide
would rise so fast.

358
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,209
He's lying.
He said he'd come back in a year,

359
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,628
but he traveled all over the world
for ten years.

360
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,673
Mura, the world of archaeology
is boundless.

361
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,760
Humans and chimpanzees diverged
from the same species

362
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,595
six million years ago.

363
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,057
Humans might have existed
longer than we have.

364
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,894
Look at that. He keeps babbling nonsense.
How would I not fight with him?

365
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,354
You guys...

366
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,107
how could you be so irresponsible?

367
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,234
No.

368
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,071
Habaek, here's the thing.

369
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,323
If you hadn't lost the map,

370
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,742
everything would have been fine.

371
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,579
The map would have brought you
to wherever we were.

372
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,623
Don't you think?

373
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,592
We did our best to find it.

374
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,678
But I've been busy.

375
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,931
Strange things have been happening
to the rivers in the south.

376
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,432
It's been stressing me out.

377
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,517
Fine.

378
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,810
And...

379
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,563
Judong can be very obsessive, you know.

380
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,859
When he's up to something, he disappears
and never gets in touch.

381
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,193
Why did you go there that day?

382
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,612
Judong must have been
working around there.

383
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,408
He asked me to come,
saying something was odd.

384
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,119
"Something odd"?

385
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,996
What was it?

386
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,915
Well, I don't know.

387
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,960
I got into a fight with Biryeom
as soon as I got there.

388
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,549
-Why did you guys fight?
-You don't need to know.

389
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,105
Don't worry.

390
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,150
You still have a lot of time
until the last red tide.

391
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,277
We'll be able to find them before that.

392
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,195
I don't like it,

393
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,782
but Biryeom stays close with
the low-level deities that are here.

394
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,118
I'm sure he's doing
some legwork at the moment.

395
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,038
The fact that you lost the map
isn't the problem.

396
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,124
They shouldn't have sent
the sacred stones here to begin with.

397
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,002
I mean, what does it have to do
with becoming the king of the deities?

398
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,634
Becoming a king of the divine realm
has nothing to do with humans,

399
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,594
so why is the sacred stone kept there?

400
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,929
What a hassle.

401
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,641
That's what I'm saying.

402
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,645
I have a shoot.

403
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,396
-You should get going.
-All right.

404
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:21,856
Habaek...

405
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,445
I'm sorry.

406
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,798
One more thing.

407
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,637
I really don't like that outfit
you're wearing.

408
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,482
Gosh,
I'm buying so many cell phones lately.

409
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,653
That jerk Ahn Bin's number is...

410
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,364
I don't have his number.
Habaek's number...

411
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,200
I don't have his number either.
What am I doing?

412
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,370
Those jerks' numbers can't be
the first numbers I save on my new phone.

413
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,875
Hello?

414
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,252
<i>It's me.</i>

415
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,129
Sorry?

416
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,464
-Who is this--
-Bring my car. I have to go somewhere.

417
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,549
Pardon me?

418
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,812
I said you could just give me the keys.

419
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,439
Why did you come with me?

420
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,152
What do I need to get that thing
called "driver's license"?

421
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,195
A government-issued ID

422
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,281
and three color photos
taken within six months.

423
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,616
Then take the written, driving
course, and on-road driving tests.

424
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,869
Why? Do you want to get one?

425
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,204
It sounds like a nuisance, but I'll do it.

426
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,958
How are you going to get an ID?

427
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,878
ID?

428
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,424
Buy one for me, and give me the receipt.

429
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,426
Forget it.

430
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,264
Why did you need to come here?

431
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:21,934
Here?

432
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,980
What a strange coincidence.

433
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,316
This spot must be cursed.

434
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,276
I lost something here too.

435
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,321
I hope the jerk who stole it from me
got his feet hurt badly.

436
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,073
You should've been more careful.

437
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,657
Dear gods, if you actually exist,

438
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,702
please make every one of his toes
gets infected with athlete's foot.

439
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,829
And I want candida fungus
on every toenail of his--

440
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,290
No god I know would do such a thing.

441
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,253
You said even Namsuri couldn't find it.

442
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,882
But still, I wanted to check just in case.

443
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,594
What does the map look like again?

444
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,639
There's no point in telling you
because it won't be visible to you.

445
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,350
Who knows? I may be able to see it
because I'm a divine servant.

446
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,310
You won't understand even if I tell you.

447
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,728
Who knows?

448
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,230
I might understand.

449
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,565
It's hard to describe what it's like.

450
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,067
Who knows?

451
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,486
I may be able to figure out
what you're trying to say.

452
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,782
It's fluid like water and definitive
like fire at the same time.

453
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,910
The unbending truth that is engraved
on a hard and dry surface.

454
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,703
Every moment is at a still stop

455
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,455
and flowing at the same time

456
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,624
to arrive at the one perfect answer.

457
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,087
If you see anything that fits
this description, you should...

458
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,756
make sure to pick it up right away.

459
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,051
I'll just wait for you. Take your time.

460
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,544
Ahn Bin, that jerk.

461
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,221
RECENT CALLS

462
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,611
Give me Ahn Bin's number.

463
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,362
-Who?
-Ahn...

464
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,616
Well, I mean the god, Biryeom.

465
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,700
What's his number?

466
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,285
I told you to stay far away from him.

467
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,829
I left something in his car.

468
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,164
Please?

469
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,378
Gosh, how mean!

470
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,508
Fine, I won't disturb you.

471
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,099
Mr...

472
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,061
MR. NATURE

473
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:17,026
THE ONE WHO PROTECTS ME

474
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:22,490
GUARDIAN

475
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,794
WATER DEMON

476
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,355
He always sits in that rubber bin
and reads newspapers.

477
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,857
Or he spends all his time
surfing on the internet.

478
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,987
Because I'm so used to seeing him
sitting down idly,

479
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,740
I can't believe that I'm watching him
trying his best to do something.

480
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,010
<i>He asked me to come,</i>
<i>saying something was odd.</i>

481
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,805
<i>Something odd?</i>

482
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,557
What's he doing now?

483
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,018
Is he praying? Or is he sleeping?

484
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,728
Is he showing off his jawline?

485
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,440
<i>I promise you.</i>

486
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,401
I'll make sure that your life...

487
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,530
will never be put in danger again
because of what we do...

488
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,744
and that I'll protect you.

489
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,539
That's a god's duty.

490
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,499
A god's...

491
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,586
duty?

492
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,927
-What are you recording?
-Oh, gosh.

493
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,804
I...

494
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,098
I was just...

495
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,017
-Did you find it?
-No, I didn't.

496
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,727
I must've lost it on the way.

497
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,729
What is it?

498
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,692
-Do you want to take photos?
-Photos?

499
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,569
Let's commemorate this moment.

500
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,614
Neither of us have fond memories of
this spot, so let's remember it.

501
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,200
Why would you want
to commemorate such a thing?

502
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,285
Consider it an honor.

503
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,204
Then let's...

504
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,757
-I can't get us in the frame.
-Give it to me.

505
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,850
Do you want that tree in the photo too?

506
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,102
Yes.

507
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,356
There.

508
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,961
One.

509
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,588
Two.

510
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,882
Three.

511
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,427
Again.

512
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,639
Again.

513
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,975
Again.

514
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,437
-Are you stupid?
-Can't you time it right?

515
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,355
Aren't you a god?

516
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,481
Again.

517
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,404
One, two, three!

518
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,910
Let's go. Let's just go.

519
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,334
I'll send you the pictures.

520
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,340
Show me the photos from today.

521
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,177
<i>There are six photos.</i>

522
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,347
Send them to Water Demon.

523
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,057
What?

524
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,311
THERE ARE 6 PHOTOS TO SEND
PLEASE CONFIRM

525
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,271
<i>Please select your delivery method.</i>

526
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,814
TO WATER DEMON

527
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,983
You're such a good girl.

528
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,338
Will it all be over
once you find the last god?

529
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,923
That's right.

530
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,134
Then will you be going back?

531
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,427
I will be.

532
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,972
I guess your promise
to protect me was temporary.

533
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,182
What?

534
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,642
Nothing.

535
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,521
What if you go back
and you still don't have your power?

536
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,481
That won't happen,

537
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,650
since I am the Land of Water
and it is me.

538
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,860
Nature is meant to return to nature.

539
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,364
I am a bit flabbergasted, though.

540
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,283
They were being so mean
because they lost them?

541
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,994
To be honest, I thought
there was a grand conspiracy.

542
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,330
-Conspiracy?
-Yes.

543
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:26,043
Like a fight for the throne? I guess
that doesn't exist in the land of deities.

544
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,295
Kings are born. It is destined.

545
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,589
I hear humans choose their kings.

546
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,466
There's no king.

547
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,595
They are delegated authority
temporarily by the people,

548
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,305
because the people are busy.

549
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,307
-Delegated?
-Yes.

550
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,602
The problem is that they often forget.

551
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,566
That's why you have to pick someone
with a good memory.

552
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,070
Although it doesn't matter
since I'm going to leave.

553
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,656
Does it really not matter?

554
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:56,991
What?

555
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,538
What if I have to leave
the Land of Water forever?

556
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,666
What if I can never return?

557
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,464
Would I feel like it doesn't matter,
like you do?

558
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,301
Naturally, that will never happen...

559
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,638
since I can't even imagine
the Land of Water without me.

560
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,196
What is that smell?

561
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,200
I just had a drink with my boss.

562
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,827
We didn't have any customers.

563
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,288
Tell me where Bin is.

564
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,832
I need to go and see my land.

565
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,459
-What?
-I need to check something.

566
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,377
I'm busy too.

567
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,838
I told you, there's no need
to meet with him. Let's go.

568
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,673
I'll decide whether or not
I need to see him.

569
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,051
I need to check something today.

570
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,428
You people...

571
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,430
Aren't you hungry?

572
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,067
-Hello?
-I'm back.

573
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,194
-Are you closing your clinic?
-Yeom-mi!

574
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,071
I heard you left this morning.

575
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,199
It's fine. We have no patients anyway.

576
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,576
-Still--
-You evil witch!

577
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,328
How could you do this to me?

578
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,205
Do you know what I've been through?

579
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,791
You don't care whether I live or die,
do you?

580
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,213
You said I was your one and only friend.

581
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,382
You don't care if I get robbed, scammed,

582
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,676
or if a water demon torments me, do you?

583
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,885
You don't--

584
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,470
Hello? What's this?

585
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:43,931
Hello?

586
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,725
<i>Come to my shop.</i>
<i>I want to introduce you to someone.</i>

587
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,228
That robber. Scammer.

588
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,105
Particularly that water demon.

589
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,191
You don't mean me, do you?

590
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,405
If you're done, let's go.

591
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,116
-Let's eat first.
-We're going to my friend.

592
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,210
Why is Jude Law
still stuck to you like glue?

593
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,462
You have no right to ask that now.

594
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,506
There's a time for everything.

595
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,092
I'll introduce you since you're curious.

596
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,553
This is Lord Habaek, the God of Water.

597
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,557
This is his subordinate, Namsuri.

598
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,516
Hello.

599
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,854
I guess you're very angry.

600
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,481
Fine. I did stay extra long this time.

601
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,946
I had my reasons.
I met someone incredible at Gyeryongsan.

602
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,491
He goes by the name of Master Donggak.
He's really gifted.

603
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,118
Is he?

604
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,246
He received the gift long ago,
but it's still strong.

605
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,164
Is that right?

606
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,083
He has to return to Gyeryongsan tomorrow,
so you have to meet him.

607
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,168
Forget it. I'm busy.

608
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,545
Do as I say.

609
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,256
You two can wait right there.

610
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,467
Goodness!

611
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,094
Stop it!

612
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,977
This is the friend I mentioned.

613
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,439
She may be young,
but she's been through a lot.

614
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,941
Ask where your father is.

615
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,902
I wish I could see it myself.

616
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,404
I can see everyone else's fortune
but yours.

617
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,866
That's why I go to Gyeryongsan
in case I'm not devoted enough.

618
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,747
Parents aren't in your fortune.

619
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:34,833
See?

620
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,420
Please take good care of her.

621
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,557
You don't look like
you should be below someone else.

622
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:56,104
You should at least be blessed
with a good man, but you're not.

623
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:01,151
You have had a headache recently
because of some land.

624
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,320
It's your land, but it isn't.

625
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,364
But it can't become someone else's either.

626
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,907
You can't sell it.

627
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,993
You are wrong. I'm selling it.

628
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,579
What's the point in great luck
coming your way with your fate?

629
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,998
You thought it was a pot of gold,
but it was a pot of coal.

630
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,668
It's like sand being thrown on your food.

631
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,461
Why?

632
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,382
You have something stiff
blocking your path, so luck evades you.

633
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,260
He's a stubborn one.

634
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,554
"Stubborn"?

635
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,890
A deity came into your home.
An evil spirit.

636
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,226
If you don't get rid of it first,

637
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,436
even gold will turn into gravel.

638
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,274
He isn't an evil spirit.

639
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,276
He's a real god.

640
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,196
Hey!

641
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,991
Would an evil spirit admit
he's an evil spirit?

642
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,159
Who's calling whom an evil spirit?

643
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,246
Who is that little...

644
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,331
What's wrong?

645
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,374
Jugeollin.

646
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,918
How dare you...

647
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,670
How dare you!

648
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,385
Lord Habaek. Please, don't kill me.

649
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,345
No. Kill me.

650
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,889
No, don't kill...

651
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,518
Oh, my gosh! You fish!

652
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,230
Jugeollin!

653
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:24,985
Stop him!

654
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,194
-Oh, my gosh! Master!
-Move!

655
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,494
Excuse me. Would you please...

656
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,579
Sure.

657
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,539
No, not like this.

658
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,503
This isn't right, you punk!

659
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,416
Where? Where did he go?

660
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,210
That way. What's wrong with him?

661
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:24,836
He's a voracious deity.

662
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,214
A voracious deity?

663
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,773
I'm sorry!

664
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,400
Move!

665
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,758
Gosh, I'm alive!

666
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,910
Stop right there!

667
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,621
Even without his power, he's super fast.

668
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,268
Hey. Get over here.

669
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,561
Get over here!

670
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,604
No!

671
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,906
What happened?

672
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,908
I thought he'd rise into the sky,

673
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,910
but he sank into the ground.

674
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,119
What on earth?

675
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,256
Darn it!

676
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,812
Here you go.

677
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,113
Enjoy.

678
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,449
He got worse after seeing Jugeollin.

679
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,785
It looks like an intense
subjective symptom.

680
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,495
It'll calm down soon.

681
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,921
What do you plan to do
after you catch that voracious deity?

682
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,715
-We need to lift the curse.
-You can do that?

683
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,552
Of course. It isn't difficult. You see--

684
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,719
Namsuri.

685
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,139
How do you lift it?

686
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,309
Well, the thing is...

687
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,063
I see.

688
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,065
They have to kiss again?

689
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,319
What's the big deal?

690
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,239
I guess it'd be awkward.

691
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,409
Still, what's the big deal?

692
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,828
I guess it'd be awkward.

693
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,455
It's better than being hungry forever.

694
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,207
Just close your eyes and...

695
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,293
I won't be hungry forever.

696
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,420
It'll be automatically lifted
once we return to our world.

697
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,754
His power too.

698
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,174
When you go back?

699
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,057
About that curse...

700
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,186
how do I get it lifted from my family?

701
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,067
Yours isn't a curse. It's a promise.

702
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,945
-Is it different?
-It is.

703
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,698
Why did my ancestors make such a promise?

704
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,617
-They committed a sin.
-What sin?

705
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,120
I really want to know.
I'll agree to it if it's reasonable.

706
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,831
There was a woman.

707
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,126
She was sold and thrown into the water.

708
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,170
The king of the Land of Water
looked kindly on her

709
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,755
and let her live in the Land of Water.

710
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,548
She lived in luxury.

711
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,429
However, at some point,

712
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,058
she began to lose weight,
worrying about her blind father.

713
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,227
So he let her go visit.

714
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,356
He sent her with gold and silver...

715
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,108
and she never returned.

716
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,656
It turned out
she married the king of her land.

717
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,369
The entire world of deities
was outraged at the betrayal.

718
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,039
He was so good to her.

719
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:19,130
Was that woman's last name "Shim,"
by any chance?

720
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,466
Shim Chong?

721
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:24,844
Let's go.

722
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,141
Let's go.

723
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,692
-Can I get this boxed up?
-Okay.

724
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,371
My dad's last name is Yun,
and my mom's is Kang.

725
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,499
At least make sure
the last name is the same next time.

726
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,376
Bring me to Bin.

727
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,378
I told you, you don't need to see him.

728
00:54:58,878 --> 00:54:59,879
Look here.

729
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,551
-What is that?
-What you need.

730
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,515
I think it's So-a's. Bring it to her.

DECLARATION OF INTENT TO SELL PROPERTY

732
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,321
What is this?

733
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,406
How dare you think
of selling a god's land?

734
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,034
-Hey!
-I was too stunned to read it all.

735
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,244
It was obviously about selling the land.

736
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,246
I don't know to whom
you wanted to sell it,

737
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,998
but don't waste their time.

738
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:38,084
I'll forgive you this one time,
so let's go there now.

739
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,337
Why is this your land?

740
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,838
This is my land!

741
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,214
That land will never be sold.

742
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,886
Why are you doing this to me?

743
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,847
This was...

744
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,726
This was so important to me.

745
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,478
You may sell everything else,

746
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,522
-but not the land.
-There's nothing else to sell!

747
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,277
Ms. Descendant!

748
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,328
Wait.

749
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,295
I was slightly happy
when you said you'd protect me.

750
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,634
I wanted to believe you
since you said it was a god's duty.

751
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,472
I thought...

752
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,310
I finally had someone on my side,
as you had mentioned.

753
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,491
I thought...

754
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,577
it was a good thing...

755
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,747
that you lived with me.

756
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,130
I had ridiculous thoughts like that.

757
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,261
I knew that one morning,

758
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,721
you'd be gone, but...

759
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,142
I knew that, but...

760
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,902
I thought it would be okay
to be excited for the time being.

761
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,533
Like an idiot...

762
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,957
I was slightly happy today.

763
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,258
That angers me so much.

764
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,595
It angers me.

765
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,817
I have no idea what kind of a person...

766
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,735
No.

767
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,488
I have no idea...

768
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,911
what kind of a god you are.

769
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,585
I am...

770
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,298
-the king of the Land of Water.
-Exactly.

771
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,886
You're from a much greater world.

772
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,683
You should do greater things.

773
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,190
Non-consequential little things...

774
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,401
can fade like a sound traveling far away,

775
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,656
but it wouldn't matter.

778

Ms. Yun?

779
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:49,687
The personal space
where you are right now.

780
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,231
Do you mind if I stop by?

781
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,612
Please.

782
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,354
So-a!

783
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,857
So-a!

784
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,661
So-a.

785
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,372
So-a!

01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,375
So-a!

So-a!

<i>I said I'd protect you because--</i>

789
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:27,326
<i>I can read people's emotions if I want to.</i>

790
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,911
<i>I told him to stay away from my woman.</i>

<i>-Let's go home together.</i>

792
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,416
<i>What does this mean?</i>

793
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,834
<i>I'm the only one who has it tough.</i>

794
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,837

797
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,426
I'm sorry too.

<i>What are you doing?</i>

799
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,345
<i>Think of it as your early farewell party.</i>

800
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,431
<i>The wind that shook your heart...</i>

801
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:49,766
<i>It has already stopped.</i>
